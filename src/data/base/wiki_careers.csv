"FAQ","Q: Can I do an internship/co-op during my first year? Answer: The co-op program does not start until the summer of your 2nd year; however, you can apply to internships on your own in 1st year. You should try to apply to places in 1st year, you have nothing to lose! Q: What is the difference between a co-op and internship? Answer: Co-op and internship jobs are usually very similar. They're both short-term jobs. Co-ops are usually landed through the co-op program, whereas for internships you apply to them like a normal job (i.e. find postings online and apply). See the Co-Op Versus Internship section for more details. Q: Should I pay for co-op or just go for internships? Answer: Do both! Apply for internships and use co-op as a fallback. Once you've gotten your first co-op/internship it's significantly easier to get the next one on your own, and many people outgrow the co-op program. Q: Can I apply for internships while in the co-op program? Answer: Co-op advisors advise against applying without their permission, but in the end there's nothing stopping you from applying for internships on your own. If you find one by yourself and want to stay in the co-op program, co-op will gladly accept that company as a co-op placement after a little screening. Q: Do grades matter? Answer: For most co-op applications you must submit your transcript. Smaller/local companies may look at grades. However, for internships, you will not need to submit your transcript for 99% of applications."

"Is Co-Op Right For You?","Last updated on 2023/10/15: The University of Windsor provides Co-Op options for both undergraduate honours and graduate computer science programs. Although it is an excellent opportunity for you to develop practical skills, you should consider the pros and cons of Co-Op and whether it is worthwhile for you. Here are some benefits you get from participating in the Co-Op program: 1. Work experience: you can get workplace experience while you're still in school. This will not only boost your resume, but also give you an idea what your career can look like after graduation. 2. Money: although wages vary from student to student, you will be paid for the work that you do during the work terms. 3. Network: you get to interact with other Co-Op students and professionals in your industry. This is an opportunity for you to develop your professional network and to learn about the career paths that you were not aware of. 4. Skills: from your employment, you will be able to develop technical and soft skills outside of the classroom environment. Co-Op is also a chance for you to find the in-demand skills in your career field. 4. Time management: during the Fall term of your second year, you will need to enroll in an extra class for Co-Op training (Transform module). You will also need to apply to job positions and interview for them during your study semesters prior to your work semesters. This is a way for you to practice managing your career and academic workload. When you are applying for post-graduation jobs during your last year, this skill will come handy to you. However, you should also consider some of the drawbacks of Co-Op: 1. Less time flexibility: you are required to enroll in full time studies (4 or more classes) in the semesters before and after a work term. If you want to change your sequence from the standard Co-Op sequence, you must make a schedule for the classes you will take for the rest of your program and get it approved by the Co-Op office. 2. Less academic flexibility: to maintain your position in Co-Op, you must maintain a cumulative average of 60%, major average of 65% and no more than one outstanding grade below 50%. 3. More fees: you must pay extra semesters of Co-Op fees during your enrollment (see the note below for more detail). Even when you withdraw from the program, you must continue to pay this fee for two more semesters. 4. You are graded: during your work semesters, you are expected to write reports, assessments, learning objectives and portfolios. These activities, along with your employer's evaluation of you, will be used to determine if you passed/failed this work term. NOTE: The total cost of your Co-Op fees is dependent on the number and length of your work terms. Standardly, domestic students pay $460 for 8 semesters ($3680 in total), and international students pay $570 for 8 semesters ($4560 in total). However, if your placement is 8 months long instead of 4 months, you will make 5 payments instead and thus pay less in total. Note that this amount is for 2023-2024 and may change for future semesters. After reading some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of Co-Op, perhaps you are able to have a better picture on whether you should enroll in a Co-Op program. If you would like to have a deeper discussion about Co-Op, you can contact our current CSS Career Advisor, Borhan Saflo (email: saflob@uwindsor.ca), or our Work Integrated Learning Coordinator for STEM, Kyle Cacilhas (email: cacilhak@uwindsor.ca).

"Finding Jobs","See Eric's presentation (link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SmtxP4vNIoEEulzTKZvc8nDBA1utS7O0fIA_d3h0gOU/edit?usp=sharing) on behalf of CSS for landing internships. It covers a bit of everything, from resumes to applying and nailing your interview. For co-op, job listings are located on the central co-op portal (link: https://success.uwindsor.ca/home.htm). For internships, you have to find listings on your own. Some good places to search: LinkedIn Jobs. LinkedIn isn't just a social platform for bugging recruiters! It has an integrated job board with tons of internships. Intern Supply, though the links are usually broken. It can serve as a master list of fantastic companies that offer internships. Work In Tech has an extensive list of job opportunities, though most of them are not internships. Pitt-CSC (link: https://github.com/pittcsc) has a giant open source repo that tracks open CS internships for a lot of companies. The organization had a repo for new grad roles, but it is no longer maintained. A current version is maintained by coderQuad (link: https://github.com/coderQuad/New-Grad-Positions-2023). WARNING: Co-op has been known to decline winter internship offers for second-year students because they haven't completed their co-op course training. If you wish to have a winter internship before you have done your co-op course training, make sure it is one that doesn't go through co-op."
"Cover Letters","Last updated on 2023/09/24: Why Cover Letter? While your resume will highlight and summarize your most relevant skills and experience, your cover letter will emphasize your most important qualifications and your personality. An effective cover letter should convince the recruiter that you possess relevant skills and the right attitude that adds value to the company. It's also a chance to show your excitement and interest in the company before the interview. Content of your Cover Letter Header Your header should look the same as the header on your resume as mentioned above. It's more professional and consistent when you look at your entire application. Date The date of the cover letter should match the day you submitted your job application. Employer's Info You must include the employer's name, their job title, the name of the company, and the address of the workplace. You might need to do some research regarding the employer and the company because the required information may not be in the job posting. If you can't find some of the information even after researching, then it's okay to just include the name of the company. But include as much information as you find. Salutation The formal way to start a salutation is with 'Dear'. If you know the full name of your employer, then use the employer's first and last name in your salutation. If the name of the employer is not given, then you can refer to them as 'Hiring Manager' or 'Recruiter'. Introduction This section of your cover letter is the most important. Your introductory paragraph will determine whether the reader will read the rest of your cover letter or not. Thus, it's very important to grab your employer's attention in this paragraph. Here are some ways you can grab your employer's attention: Discuss your passion for working with the company and why you're excited Briefly highlight your most relevant skills and experiences Demonstrate your knowledge of the company by mentioning their products and services When expressing your interest in the position you're applying for, you must talk about how the company will benefit when they select you rather than what you can gain from the job. Employers will always prioritize the success of the company and will select applicants based on that. Middle This paragraph (or two) will go into detail regarding the relevant skills and experience you mentioned in your introductory paragraph or on your resume. This is where you prove you are the perfect candidate for the job. You do this by demonstrating you understand the role and what will be required from you in the workplace. Do not try to go over everything on your resume. Discuss one or two relevant experiences (work, volunteering, projects, etc) that relate to the requirements and skills the employer is asking for. Conclusion This final paragraph should summarize your relevant skills and interests. You should thank the employer for taking the time to review your application and express your interest in an interview. You should end off with 'Sincerely' or 'Regards' followed by your first and last name. Don't forget to include your signature."
"Sample Cover Letter","Here is a sample cover letter that you can use as a blueprint for your future cover letters: Date Company Name Workplace Address City State/Province Postal Code Dear Hiring Manager, I am in [Year of Study] at [University Name] majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Finance. I was excited to learn about the CME Group Summer Data Science Intern position as advertised on Handshake, and I would value the opportunity to work for a company that uses technology to impact global markets. I believe my fluency in Java and Python, along with my background in data analytics make me a strong candidate for this position. As the Open Source Website Development Intern at Loyola, I have spent this past academic year creating a website, from inception to production deployment, using JavaScript and HTML to track the prices of products on Amazon.com over time. I also wrote RSpec tests to ensure that site functionality was maintained during development and to prevent the inclusion of regression bugs. In addition, as a Research Assistant to Dr. Kalchthaler in the Loyola School of Education, I researched the use of computer software in Chicago Public Schools and analyzed data using SPSS-X software. Using Java and Python, I programmed a specialized database to track findings, and I presented research results to Dr. Kalchthaler and two PhD-level interns at weekly meetings. Through my computer science coursework at Loyola, I have gained additional programming skills in languages such as SQL and C/C++, as well as applied knowledge of operating systems such as Linux. My passion for financial markets has led me to minor in finance, through which I’ve learned about commodity and derivative markets, and become increasingly interested in global economics. I would love the opportunity to join CME Group as a Data Science Intern this summer! Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, (Handwritten Signature) First Last."
"Resumes","Creating a Resume: Recruiters spend, on average, between 6 and 10 seconds looking at your resume. Its important that your resume makes a strong first impression and demonstrates why you're a strong candidate for the position. Your resume should be at most one page, cover your past experience, technical skills, projects, relevant education, and soft skills. Do not include your secondary school education - if you've made it to University, you probably did well in secondary school. Passing the ATS Scanner: It's no surprise that resume checkers have become automated especially for larger companies who get thousands of applicants. Companies now use ATS (applicant tracking system) to parse your resumes before it reaches an actual human being. Knowing how to pass the ATS scanner is important in getting an interview. So, how do they work? ATS software uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to score and sort resumes based on how well they align with job requirements. An ATS will scan your resume for keywords and relevant work history to make a decision on whether you will advance to the next round, optimizing your resume so that it passes the ATS scan is an important step in your job search. Otherwise, your resume can be rejected despite your qualifications for the job. A few simple strategies can help set your resume up for success in passing through an applicant tracking system. Keep Things Simple An aesthetically pleasing resume with headers, different fonts, and visuals won’t do much to impress an ATS. Also, use a resume template. Resume templates have a higher chance of being parsed properly by an ATS compared to a resume made from scratch. Also, the content of your resume should be aligned to the left. It makes your resume more readable this way. “Most ATS strip out formatting and parse the plain text, but you can still make your resume look nice. It is best to stay away from inserting graphics, columns, headers, footers, or tables. ATS reads top to bottom and left to right, if you have columns built into separate information the ATS might read two separate categories of information as one. Standard headers for categories, bold, capital letters, italics are all ok. Most ATS can read a PDF but Word document is almost always the safest bet.” says Carolyn Kleiman, career coach and expert at ResumeBuilder.com I recommend using templates from Overleaf since they're designed to be properly parsed by ATS. Even so, stick with simple looking templates without anything fancy. Don't Forget to Include Keywords Another tip is to carefully tailor your resume to the job description. If there are skills listed in the job description that you have, make sure to add them before you submit it. ATS scans for keywords that were listed in the job description. This also helps once your resume reaches a recruiter. Recruiters aren't people with programming knowledge. They'll be asked to look for the listed keywords from the posting."
"Different Sections of a Resume","Header: Include your name, contact information, GitHub, Linkedin and your personal website (if you have one) Your name must be the largest font Education Put down the University you're studying at and the name of your program Include relevant coursework Only include your GPA if it's above a 90 Skills Refer to the job description and add essential keywords on your resume to increase your chance of getting an interview DO NOT simply list all the keywords on the job description for the sake of showing you’re a good fit. You WILL be questioned on the skills you've listed in the interview Projects The most important section if you don't have experience Projects can showcase your passion for programming and your knowledge on languages and tools a company utilizes. “Build some iPhone apps, web apps, whatever! Honestly it doesn’t matter that much what you’re building as long as you’re building something. You can build a fairly meaty project in one weekend. This means that with about 3–4 weekends of work, you can make your résumé go from so-so to fantastic. Seriously — I’ve seen lots of people do this.” - Gayle McDowell, former Google Engineer and Author of Cracking the Coding Interview. Experience Focus only on including work experience that has relevance to the job that you are applying for Keep your points brief and to the point Have various versions of your resume tailored for each job you are applying for. There is no one-size-fits-all resume. The most important thing is to describe what you've accomplished, not just what task you were assigned. Use the “Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]” formula. It’s the most effective way of showing recruiters your impact. In general, numbers and metrics are a great way to show off the positive impact you had at your workplace. List of Action Words to Use on your Resume (link: https://www.colorado.edu/career/job-searching/resumes-and-cover-letters/resumes/action-verbs-use-your-resume) - When you have no clue how to word your accomplishments, use this website for ideas :). Others Other sections include extracurriculars, awards, certificates, volunteering, etc. Include them if they relate to the job you're applying to or if it's something exceptional. Things to include can relate the following: 1. Computer science related volunteering experience. 2. Certificates that relate to the skills the job is asking for. 3. Getting 1st or 2nd place at a hackathon. 4. President, vice-president or a head of a club."
"Interviews","Interview Preparation: Eric recommends studying and practicing technical interview questions for any mid-to-large-sized company. Most of them will ask you highly technical coding questions. Interview Prep Resources: LeetCode - Eric highly recommends LeetCode and has used it for all of his interview prep. It has hundreds of questions with difficulty ratings and company-specific questions submitted by interviewees. Most internships will ask LeetCode easy or medium questions. LeetFree - This website contains all LeetCode Premium problems for free. Cracking the Coding Interview - Eric highly recommends reading this book before getting into LeetCode for interview prep. You can find it on Amazon or as a PDF online. Cracking the Coding Interview Solutions - Online solutions for the problems in Cracking the Coding Interview. Harshdip recommends to try all the problems on your own and only looking for solutions once you have tried everything you know. HackerRank - Brandon highly recommends getting familiar with the HackerRank editor and available languages. Many companies will supply a timed HackerRank coding challenge to be completed when applying to internships. It can also be used like LeetCode to solve hundreds of technical programming problems. Glassdoor - Glassdoor allows people to post reviews, salaries and most importantly interview questions they've received from specific companies. 27 Most Common Interview Questions (link: https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/27-most-common-job-interview-questions-and-answers.html) - An interview is a test, and here's the testbank."
"Working in the United States","Working in the US: Almost every major tech company in the US hires Canadians and will sponsor you for a visa (usually an application will specify if they won't sponsor a visa). US companies tend to pay significantly more and offer great opportunities. Visa: You'll need a visa to intern/work full-time in the US. A common misconception is that you can get a visa yourself - this is not true. You need a company who is willing to sponsor your visa to work in the United States. Once you find this company they will do most of the work for you, you'll just have to submit some documents/forms. Don't stress about this step. Visa-Job Type-Citizenship-Notes \n J-1 Visa-Internship-Any-Generally straight forward; you'll get a 30 day grace period before/after your internship period. \n TN Visa-Full Time-Canadian Only-Generally quicker/easier to obtain than an H1-B. \n H1-B Visa-Full Time-Any-Only 65k are given every year; lengthier/harder visa to obtain. \end. Getting Paid: You'll need an American bank account or a cross-border banking account (e.g. TD Cross-Border Banking) to get paid if you're working in the US. This is very easy to obtain - just go to your preferred bank once you're in the US and bring your passport, job offer letter, and visa documents just in case. They may ask for a US address to open an American bank account. Some companies will require you to obtain a Social Security Number in the US. It's also a very good idea regardless so that you can apply for a credit card and build up a credit score in the US (can be helpful in many ways in the future). This is also straight-forward, but you need to wait until you're in the US for at least 10 days before you can apply and you might also need to wait for your employment to start.
