"About CSS","CSS, The Computer Science Society is a group of elected students that represent all undergraduate students enrolled in Computer Science at the University of Windsor. We aim to improve the university experience for all CS students by hosting outings, workshops, providing resources, and more! How do I get Involved? Everyone in the Computer Science Society is elected by you, the undergraduate students in CS. See the CSS Constitution which contains the titles and descriptions of all roles in CSS. Elections are now split up into two rounds. Nominations for the first round of positions which includes all head and executive positions takes place in February, and the second round for the rest of the positions takes place in March. If a student runs for a position in the first round and fails to get the votes, they may run for another position in the second round. The vote for our two first-year representatives for the current school year usually takes place in September or October. When the time comes, everyone will be notified via email and Discord on how to nominate and vote for CSS positions. The most current chart showing the hierarchy of positions on CSS: President is at the top, and supervises the Treasurer, the Vice President, the Secretary, and the Head of Technology. The Vice President supervises the Head of Student Affairs and the Head of Events. The Treasurer supervises the Head of Communications. The Head of Communications supervises the Design Coordinator, the Merchandise Coordinator, and the Promotions Coordinator. The Head of Technology supervises 2 Moderators as well as the CSS developer team. The Head of Student Affairs supervises the Career Advisor, the First Year Rep, The Second Year Rep, The Senior Rep, and the CSC Liason. The Head of Events supervises the Event Organizer and 4 Event Coordinators. Contact Us You can contact any of us individually through the Discord server or by using our respective email addresses.

"Programs Overview","Bachelor of Computer Science Programs Computer Science - Both general and honours programs are offered, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Computer Science (B.C.S.). Each permits the student to augment a specialized study of computers with an extensive study of one of a number of related fields, or with a broad spectrum of other courses. A Cooperative Education program is offered in Honours Computer Science. Also offered are B.Sc. programs leading to degrees in Computer Information Systems Specialization, or with Software Engineering Specialization."
"Programs Regulations","COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAM AND CO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION REGULATIONS ENGLISH PROFICIENCY It is highly recommended that students take English ENGL-1001 (Composition) as students in Computer Science should develop good oral and written communications skills, besides technical proficiency in the basic science. SELECTION OF COURSES In selecting courses to meet the requirements of the programs outlined below, the following general regulations also must be observed: 1) A student registering in a course without having successfully completed the prerequisite course(s) will be required to drop that course unless the consent of the Director of Computer Science (or her/his designate) is obtained. 2) If two or more courses cover essentially the same material, only one may be taken for credit. 3) The prior approval of the Director of Computer Science (or her/his designate) must be obtained in order to substitute any courses for required ones. 4) Statistics courses other than those specifically listed as being required for the degree, or ones for which the required statistics courses are themselves prerequisites, may not be taken for credit. 5) In general, Computer Science courses offered in other areas may not be taken for credit. COMP-1047, COMP-2067, COMP-2057, COMP-2077, COMP-2707, and COMP-3057 may not be used to satisfy the major requirements of any degree program in Computer Science, or in joint programs with Computer Science, unless permission is obtained from the Director of Computer Science (or her/his designate). "
"Co-op Overview","CO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION The Co-operative Education Program is available for the following degrees: Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours Applied Computing) Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Information Systems) Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Science with Software Engineering Specialization) Introduction The Co-operative Education Program offers students the opportunity to combine their classroom experiences with related work experiences. Students who apply and are accepted into the Co-operative Education Program must successfully complete at least three paid work experiences interspersed throughout the four-year Honours program. The experience gained while participating in these structured and supervised work placements is viewed as an integral component of the student's educational program."
"Co-op Regulations","All Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the University. The process of securing a Co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek Co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process facilitated by the Centre for Career Education. Academic Regulations Computer Science Co-op students must maintain full-time academic status and satisfy the following: (a) Must maintain a minimum average of 60%, and (b) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65%, (c) Must not have more than one grade below 50% on their transcript, and; (d) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65% during the one semester probation period. General Information Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for placement. In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed their work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the Co-op program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that work term.
