"Textbook Guide","Textbook Guide Getting your textbooks should be a relatively straightforward process. However, if you care about your wallet there are some questions you should ask first. Do I Need Textbooks? This is the first question you should ask before worrying about how you'll get your textbooks. Many classes list required textbooks when in actuality they're never used in the course. Your best bet is to find a student who has taken the course already and ask them if the listed textbook is actually necessary. More often than not, you don't actually need the textbook. Jeremie's Advice Courseware If the course lists a 'courseware' as a required textbook, I would recommend purchasing it from the bookstore. Almost always, coursewares will be inexpensive and extremely useful. NOTE 'Courseware' refers to a textbook that is written by the professor and printed by the University Other Textbooks If the course lists a non-courseware textbook as required, there's a very high chance you don't need it. Ask the professor if it's actually required and also try to find students who have taken the course before. List of Courses You Probably Won't Need The Textbook For Here is a list of first- and second-year courses you probably won't need to purchase a textbook for: COMP-1000, COMP-1400, COMP-1410, COMP-2120, COMP-2140, COMP-2540, COMP-2560, COMP-2650, COMP-2660, COMP-2800, MATH-1250, MATH-1720, MATH-1020, MATH-1730 WARNING This list may not be 100% accurate. It was based on the personal experiences of students who took these courses in the past. As courses evolve and new professors teach them, things may change. Where Do I Get My Textbooks? Depending on what you're looking for, you have a few options for getting your textbooks. The Campus Bookstore The campus bookstore is the official way to purchase your textbooks. If you're looking to purchase a courseware, this is usually your only option. Here, all of the textbooks are arranged by class so you can easily find what you're looking for, and it will always be the exact version you need. However, the bookstore is always the most expensive option. If you can avoid the bookstore, you'll likely be able to save some money. Other Ways to Purchase There are many places where you can purchase textbooks new or used and save money: Used Textbooks Buying used textbooks is a great way to save money, as they're almost always cheaper than the bookstore. There are Facebook groups dedicated to UWindsor students posting textbooks they're selling and/or looking for. These are a great place to start. You can also ask around on Discord servers if anyone is selling their textbooks. Additionally, you can look at Kijiji and Facebook Marketplace. New Textbooks Sometimes the publisher of the textbooks sells directly to customers, and sometimes you can find new textbooks on Amazon. A simple Google search is bound to return results for the textbook you're looking for. The Library Leddy Library often stocks textbooks for students to temporarily borrow for free. While you won't be able to actually own or use the textbook on a permanent basis, this is still a great option for some people. You can find out more by visiting Leddy Library or on their website. Free E-Textbooks Here at the Computer Science Society, we love the law. We definitely recommend you to pay full price for a new book from the UWindsor bookstore and definitely do not recommend you to use the following sites such to get your textbooks for free and save hundreds of dollars without an account. These sites definitely do not provide free, safe files: b-ok.cc libgen.is pdfdrive.com"
"Course Overload Guide","Course overload is taking more courses in a term than the usual prescribed number. In the Fall and Winter terms, this means taking more than 5 courses per term. In the Intersession and Summer terms, this means taking more than 3 courses per term and more than 5 courses total. Students who have major and cumulative averages of 85% or higher may take one course on overload per term. Students with averages below this must obtain permission for course overload from the Associate Dean, Academic and Student Success. Please note that approval for course overload will only be granted in exceptional circumstances. (Source) How to Course Overload For CS students, the process of overloading is simple: Contact Tina Palmer at csinfo@uwindsor.ca. State that you'd like to course overload for the upcoming term and she'll give you a form to have filled out. Once you have the form, you'll need to fill out the relevant information about yourself and the course you'd like to overload with. Now, you must email the form to the professor of the course you'd like to overload with. They must sign the form and then hand it back off to Tina. Once the form is sent back to Tina, you've officially done all you need. From there, your form will be approved by a CS advisor as well as the Associate Dean of Science, before finally being processed by Registrars. After Registrars, you'll be added to the overloaded class! Why Course Overload You may be wondering why someome might want to course overload. Indeed, for most students 5 classes in a semester is more enough. However, overloading does have some advantages that might make it worth it if you're up to it: The cost increase of going from 5 classes in a semester to 6 classes in a semester is negligible. It's almost like you get a free class. Some courses are only offered at specific times in the year, so overloading may help prevent you from having to delay your graduation due to unfulfilled requirements. If you've ever dropped/VWd from a class, you may be slightly behind in your course sequencing. Overloading may help you get back on track. Overloading multiple semesters in a row, in conjunction with taking some summer courses, may help you graduate sooner. Helpful Tips Make sure the course you're overloading is a CS course. If you're taking at least one CS course in your overloaded semester, I'd recommend making that the course you overload. This is because different departments handle overloading differently, and you're more likely to have success dealing with the CS department. Additionally, if you're going to be taking multiple CS courses in a semester, choose a course with a professor you have a good relationship with to be your overloaded class. Since you need their consent to overload in their class, choosing which course to overload based on the professor teaching it is your best bet. Make sure all your fees are paid up on UWinsite before trying to overload. They won't let you enroll if you have an outstanding balance. Make sure you're comfortable with the workload of 6+ courses. Be prepared to either increase the amount of time you spend on school or lower your grade expectations."
"Getting Involved with Research","Is Research Right for You? If you plan to do graduate studies, research is the best way to get you started. It will give you helpful insight into how research study works, and you will build a good relationship with different faculty members who will help you when you apply for grad school. Conversely, research is a great way to let you know whether if you want to pursue graduate studies. Doing research requires a lot of independent reading and studying on the subject of your research. You will need to work with data and models. In addition, you will need to apply your knowledge and critically analyze your research to investigate a question that does not have any 'right' answer. If you feel like that you enjoy doing these things, then research may be the right path for you. It is okay to not be completely sure if you want to do research or not: going to University is the chance to explore your interests and passions. If you feel that you like the idea of continuing graduate studies or if you feel like you'd be interested in research work, then you absolutely should look for research opportunities. However, if those ideas don't appeal to you, then Co-op/Internship may be a better path. You will gain different practical skills and experience that will help you. Ways To Get Involved With Research The University has a program called Outstanding Scholars where students from all faculties can get involved in research projects. Sometimes, professors will also post research opportunities on Ignite (MySuccess) or in your student community. As well, many professors will showcase their research during fairs, Meet the Prof Nights, and other events. You can always talk to professors whose research interests you: they may be looking for more volunteers/research assistants."
"Outstanding Scholars: Pros and cons","UWindsor offers the Outstanding Scholars program for students to get involved in research projects. Student will get paid for each placement under the supervision of instructors. The program requires students to complete 6 placements in order to complete the OS program. Most students will start their placement from 3rd semester until the last semester to complete all 6 placements. Pros and Cons of Outstanding Scholars Pros Paid placement: $16.35/hour (2nd/3rd year) and $17.30/hour (4th year). Flexible total hours: 45-100 hours per placement. Great experience to put on resume or grad school application. A lot of machine learning and cyber security research projects focusing on different areas (ex. social network analysis and document and network analysis). Placements are not limited in your department. OS program is a golden key that can open any research doors for you. Outstanding Scholars Medal & Golden Maple Leaf Medallion will be awarded. Cons Time consuming. Depending on the research project, there is a lot of reading material. Depending on the research project, do not expect to code a lot. Unless you are buidling a training model for a machine learning algorithm or simulating model. Weekly or Bi-weekly meetings. Must keep close contact with professor with your progress. If your supervisor is too busy, and many of them are, then you are mostly on your own. That's why finding a good supervisor is very important."
"Outstanding Scholars: How to Apply","Applying to Outstanding Scholars During high school, you can apply to become an OS Candidate for your first year at UWindsor. However, regardless if you are an OS Candidate or not, you must apply again after your first year in order to enter the OS program as a full scholar and perform research. Applying to be an Outstanding Scholar Candidate: High school students can apply to the OS Candidates Scholarship. The selected students for this scholarship will be known as OS Candidates. During their first year, OS Candidates will receive $750 / semester, interact with other Outstanding Scholars, and have opportunities to network with professors. After their first year at the University of Windsor, OS Candidates need to re-apply to the OS Program to formally get involved with research projects. The application will be done through the Student Awards Profile at UWinsite Student, and the top 100 students applying for admission to any first-entry program at the University of Windsor will be accepted. Students are eligible to apply if their GPA, based on the top three to six Grade 12 U/M courses, is least 85%. The deadline for applications for Fall 2022 admission will be Thursday, March 31st, 2022. Applying to be a Full-fledged Outstanding Scholar: Every summer, invitations will be given out to prospective second-years to apply to the OS program to become a full scholar. Invitations will be given by email to the top 250 first-year students with the highest cumulative GPA. If a student is already an OS Candidate, then they will be invited if they are in good academic standing and has maintained a cumulative average of 80%+. Every year, the OS program will admit the top 80 second-year students as Outstanding Scholars. These Outstanding Scholars will start to find their research placement during the Fall semester of their second year. Students are eligible to apply if their cumulative GPA ranks among the top 250 first-year students. If a student is already an OS Candidate, then they will be invited if they are in good academic standing and has maintained a cumulative average of 80%+. NOTE If you complete only 9 courses for 2 semesters in first year, then you will not receive an invitation to apply for the program. However, do not worry! you can contact Dr. Tim Brunet to inform him about your interests in the program. To graduate as an OS student, you must complete 6 placements, which is 6 semesters or 3 years of your study. If you have completed more than 10 courses, you won't be able to meet the requirement. However, if you plan to take extra summer courses and do a research placement, then you are eligible to apply. Contact Dr. Tim Brunet and explain your goal to complete the program. Selection Criteria for Outstanding Scholars Academic accomplishments: GPA 85% or higher (high school) / top 250 cumulative GPA (second-year). Evident desire to do research or original creative work. Evidence of community service. Leadership, through excellence in athletic, creative, or other fields, or through serving in a formal leadership role. Specific research project that you are interested in. A reference letter from a faculty member or instructor. To get a greate reference letter, you could get to know more about a professor's research project during their office hours. This will show that you are curious and willing to learn. They will put a good word in for you."
