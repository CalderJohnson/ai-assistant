A TA (Teaching Assistant) is a unionized student position where undergraduate students can work with instructors (often professors) to run University of Windsor courses. Instructors could ask for a TA's help in a variety of ways:  Holding Office Hours   Grade student assessments  Proctor Exams  Taking notes or answering questions during classes   A TA refers to an undergraduate student while GA (Graduate Assistant) refers to Graduate students  Why should you become a TA? Being a TA provides many benefits:  Work experience with a subject of interest  Create connections with Professors and Instructors  Further your own learning on the subject  Paid Position  The Collective Agreement As mentioned above, the position of a TA is paid. This rate of pay is determined in the CUPE 4580 Collective Agreement. This agreement is where you will find all detailed information about the position and its relationship with the University and the Union. To find the rate of pay in the Collective Agreement review Schedule 'A' in the current collective agreement 1. There you will find:  TA I  make $20.39/hour (As of 01/01/2021)   TA II (Year 3 and Year 4 Students) make $21.99/hour (As of 01/01/2021) Be sure to read your rights in the Collective Agreement, it is filled with important information about the position.    How to become a TA? To become a TA a student typically needs to have completed their first year of courses.  The processes will usually begin a few months before the start of the next term: | Term | TA Process Begins | Staring Month | |::|::|::| | Winter | October | January | | Spring | March | May | | Fall | July | September | The processes starts with an email from the department explaining which courses will require TA positions and how many positions are available. This email will cover which courses will have positions available and basic information about the positions like:  All courses and labs will be on campus (including some Distance Education courses that may require on campus office hours)  All GA/TA employees must make themselves available, and must be available for all assigned duties, both oncampus and online as required  Each GA position is expected to be for a total of 140 hours. A limited number of GA positions may be available for fewer hours  The total number of hours of a TA appointment will depend on the number of applications received and is anticipated to be 75100 hours per position. Note that Teaching Assistants can be employed for no more than 100 TA hours per semester total Once confirming that you meet the basic requirements for eligibility:  Successful completion of the course (80% minimum average) or demonstrated experience/knowledge in subject matter (which will be determined by interview)   Must have a minimum cumulative average of 75%. Must have a minimum major average of 80%  Must have excellent communication skills. Brightspace/Teams experience  Must be familiar with Brightspace and MS Teams or be able to acquire knowledge through training   Remote internet access requirements: Must have access to a computer with a reliable internet connection with video and audio capabilities   Or reviewing to see if you meet the preferred requirements:\n\nPreferred qualifications will only be considered if there are 2 or more applicants who meet the required essential qualifications and who are relatively equal based on the criteria as per articles 12:03 or 12:04 of the CUPE 4580 collective agreement  Preference for TA positions will be given to applicants registered in a Computer Science program  Completion of CTL GA/TA Academy workshop (s) is an asset  Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL) Brightspace Training completed You can begin the process by visiting the School of Computer Science Online GA/TA Application website 2 There are 5 pages to fill out, including your contact information, previous experiences, and top 10 courses ranked in order of your preferred placement. Once the form is submitted, if a successful candidate you will hear back from the University with an offer letter typically 14 weeks before classes begin. One important thing to note is the University has the right to change your position if needed. This means if you are offered to TA for one course and sign the contract, they could simply send you an email saying you have been reassigned to another course instead. To accept a TA position there are a few steps involved: 1. Reply to the email offer with a message accepting the offer   E.g. 'I accept this offer and confirm that I will be available to report for inperson duties in F/W/S term 20XX.' 2. Confirm you are enrolled in at least one course  3. Digitally sign the contract 3 4. Complete the HR hiring package   This will include signing multiple forms for the University's records like an offer letter, duties check list, Ontario Taxes form , Canadian Taxes form (TD1), and possibly more   Some forms will ask for an employee number, if this is your first time working for the University leave this blank and they will provide you with one on a later date. If you have an employee number but do not remember it, look at your employee profile on the University of Windsor Employee Site 4 5. Ping a Mod in the CSS Discord to give you the TA Role    This role will help students recognize you as a TA, giving you another space to help students   It could also assist you as a way to contact other TAs in case you have a further question about the process, or responsibilities involved Once you submit all of your paper work you must wait for confirmation from HR before beginning any work as a TA. You can communicate and meet with the instructor, however not begin any work until this confirmation is received.   TA Resources Once accepting a TA position there are (https://ctl2.uwindsor.ca/workshops/) 5 that are offered by the University that you can take to help you during your term. Some training courses are required, others optional. Most are one time only, meaning the next time you are a TA, you will not be required to do them again. You can also log into your University of Windsor Employee Site(https://myuwinfo.uwindsor.ca/default) 4 to see you payment information, completed trainings, T4, and other information.  Citations 1.

It will give you helpful insight into how research study works, and you will build a good relationship with different faculty members who will help you when you apply for grad school. Conversely, research is a great way to let you know whether if you want to pursue graduate studies. Doing research requires a lot of independent reading and studying on the subject of your research. You will need to work with data and models. In addition, you will need to apply your knowledge and critically analyze your research to investigate a question that does not have any 'right' answer. If you feel like that you enjoy doing these things, then research may be the right path for you. It is okay to not be completely sure if you want to do research or not: going to University is the chance to explore your interests and passions. If you feel that you like the idea of continuing graduate studies or if you feel like you'd be interested in research work, then you absolutely should look for research opportunities. However, if those ideas don't appeal to you, then Co-op/Internship may be a better path. You will gain different practical skills and experience that will help you. Ways To Get Involved With Research The University has a program called Outstanding Scholars where students from all faculties can get involved in research projects. Sometimes, professors will also post research opportunities on Ignite (MySuccess) or in your student community. As well, many professors will showcase their research during fairs, Meet the Prof Nights, and other events. You can always talk to professors whose research interests you: they may be looking for more volunteers/research assistants.\n\n    Answer the student's query: How do I become a TA?\n"

However, if you care about your wallet there are some questions you should ask first. Do I Need Textbooks? This is the first question you should ask before worrying about how you'll get your textbooks. Many classes list required textbooks when in actuality they're never used in the course. Your best bet is to find a student who has taken the course already and ask them if the listed textbook is actually necessary. More often than not, you don't actually need the textbook. Jeremie's Advice Courseware If the course lists a 'courseware' as a required textbook, I would recommend purchasing it from the bookstore. Almost always, coursewares will be inexpensive and extremely useful. NOTE 'Courseware' refers to a textbook that is written by the professor and printed by the University Other Textbooks If the course lists a non-courseware textbook as required, there's a very high chance you don't need it. Ask the professor if it's actually required and also try to find students who have taken the course before. List of Courses You Probably Won't Need The Textbook For Here is a list of first- and second-year courses you probably won't need to purchase a textbook for: COMP-1000, COMP-1400, COMP-1410, COMP-2120, COMP-2140, COMP-2540, COMP-2560, COMP-2650, COMP-2660, COMP-2800, MATH-1250, MATH-1720, MATH-1020, MATH-1730 WARNING This list may not be 100% accurate. It was based on the personal experiences of students who took these courses in the past. As courses evolve and new professors teach them, things may change. Where Do I Get My Textbooks? Depending on what you're looking for, you have a few options for getting your textbooks. The Campus Bookstore The campus bookstore is the official way to purchase your textbooks. If you're looking to purchase a courseware, this is usually your only option. Here, all of the textbooks are arranged by class so you can easily find what you're looking for, and it will always be the exact version you need. However, the bookstore is always the most expensive option. If you can avoid the bookstore, you'll likely be able to save some money. Other Ways to Purchase There are many places where you can purchase textbooks new or used and save money: Used Textbooks Buying used textbooks is a great way to save money, as they're almost always cheaper than the bookstore. There are Facebook groups dedicated to UWindsor students posting textbooks they're selling and/or looking for. These are a great place to start. You can also ask around on Discord servers if anyone is selling their textbooks. Additionally, you can look at Kijiji and Facebook Marketplace. New Textbooks Sometimes the publisher of the textbooks sells directly to customers, and sometimes you can find new textbooks on Amazon. A simple Google search is bound to return results for the textbook you're looking for. The Library Leddy Library often stocks textbooks for students to temporarily borrow for free. While you won't be able to actually own or use the textbook on a permanent basis, this is still a great option for some people. You can find out more by visiting Leddy Library or on their website. Free E-Textbooks Here at the Computer Science Society, we love the law. We definitely recommend you to pay full price for a new book from the UWindsor bookstore and definitely do not recommend you to use the following sites such to get your textbooks for free and save hundreds of dollars without an account. These sites definitely do not provide free, safe files: b-ok.cc libgen.is pdfdrive.com\n\n  The title for COMP-4670 is \"Network Security\".

I was excited to learn about the CME Group Summer Data Science Intern position as advertised on Handshake, and I would value the opportunity to work for a company that uses technology to impact global markets. I believe my fluency in Java and Python, along with my background in data analytics make me a strong candidate for this position. As the Open Source Website Development Intern at Loyola, I have spent this past academic year creating a website, from inception to production deployment, using JavaScript and HTML to track the prices of products on Amazon.com over time. I also wrote RSpec tests to ensure that site functionality was maintained during development and to prevent the inclusion of regression bugs. In addition, as a Research Assistant to Dr. Kalchthaler in the Loyola School of Education, I researched the use of computer software in Chicago Public Schools and analyzed data using SPSS-X software. Using Java and Python, I programmed a specialized database to track findings, and I presented research results to Dr. Kalchthaler and two PhD-level interns at weekly meetings. Through my computer science coursework at Loyola, I have gained additional programming skills in languages such as SQL and C/C++, as well as applied knowledge of operating systems such as Linux. My passion for financial markets has led me to minor in finance, through which I\u2019ve learned about commodity and derivative markets, and become increasingly interested in global economics. I would love the opportunity to join CME Group as a Data Science Intern this summer! Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, (Handwritten Signature) First Last.\n\nBachelor of Computer Science Programs Computer Science - Both general and honours programs are offered, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Computer Science (B.C.S.). Each permits the student to augment a specialized study of computers with an extensive study of one of a number of related fields, or with a broad spectrum of other courses. A Cooperative Education program is offered in Honours Computer Science. Also offered are B.Sc. programs leading to degrees in Computer Information Systems Specialization, or with Software Engineering Specialization.\n\nLast updated on 2023/10/15: The University of Windsor provides Co-Op options for both undergraduate honours and graduate computer science programs. Although it is an excellent opportunity for you to develop practical skills, you should consider the pros and cons of Co-Op and whether it is worthwhile for you. Here are some benefits you get from participating in the Co-Op program: 1. Work experience: you can get workplace experience while you're still in school. This will not only boost your resume, but also give you an idea what your career can look like after graduation. 2. Money: although wages vary from student to student, you will be paid for the work that you do during the work terms. 3. Network: you get to interact with other Co-Op students and professionals in your industry. This is an opportunity for you to develop your professional network and to learn about the career paths that you were not aware of. 4. Skills: from your employment, you will be able to develop technical and soft skills outside of the classroom environment. Co-Op is also a chance for you to find the in-demand skills in your career field. 4. Time management: during the Fall term of your second year, you will need to enroll in an extra class for Co-Op training (Transform module). You will also need to apply to job positions and interview for them during your study semesters prior to your work semesters. This is a way for you to practice managing your career and academic workload. When you are applying for post-graduation jobs during your last year, this skill will come handy to you. However, you should also consider some of the drawbacks of Co-Op: 1. Less time flexibility: you are required to enroll in full time studies (4 or more classes) in the semesters before and after a work term. If you want to change your sequence from the standard Co-Op sequence, you must make a schedule for the classes you will take for the rest of your program and get it approved by the Co-Op office. 2. Less academic flexibility: to maintain your position in Co-Op, you must maintain a cumulative average of 60%, major average of 65% and no more than one outstanding grade below 50%. 3. More fees: you must pay extra semesters of Co-Op fees during your enrollment (see the note below for more detail). Even when you withdraw from the program, you must continue to pay this fee for two more semesters. 4. You are graded: during your work semesters, you are expected to write reports, assessments, learning objectives and portfolios. These activities, along with your employer's evaluation of you, will be used to determine if you passed/failed this work term. NOTE: The total cost of your Co-Op fees is dependent on the number and length of your work terms. Standardly, domestic students pay $460 for 8 semesters ($3680 in total), and international students pay $570 for 8 semesters ($4560 in total). However, if your placement is 8 months long instead of 4 months, you will make 5 payments instead and thus pay less in total. Note that this amount is for 2023-2024 and may change for future semesters. After reading some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of Co-Op, perhaps you are able to have a better picture on whether you should enroll in a Co-Op program. If you would like to have a deeper discussion about Co-Op, you can contact our current CSS Career Advisor, Borhan Saflo (email: saflob@uwindsor.ca), or our Work Integrated Learning Coordinator for STEM, Kyle Cacilhas (email: cacilhak@uwindsor.ca). Extra Readings: If you are interested in the Co-Op program, here are more resources from the Co-Op office that you can read into: 1. https://www.uwindsor.ca/coop-workplace-partnerships/ 2. https://www.uwindsor.ca/cces/1218/co-op-programs 3. https://www.uwindsor.ca/cces/ You can also look at your academic calendars for information and requirement for Co-Op programs specific to your department. For the Spring 2023 academic calendar, the Co-Op regulations for Computer Science students is on page 578: https://www.uwindsor.ca/secretariat/sites/uwindsor.ca.secretariat/files/undergraduate_calendar_spring_2023.pdf\n\n    Answer the student's query: Can I get a job from studying computer science\n"

Each permits the student to augment a specialized study of computers with an extensive study of one of a number of related fields, or with a broad spectrum of other courses. A Cooperative Education program is offered in Honours Computer Science. Also offered are B.Sc. programs leading to degrees in Computer Information Systems Specialization, or with Software Engineering Specialization.\n\nCO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION The Co-operative Education Program is available for the following degrees: Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours Applied Computing) Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Information Systems) Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Science with Software Engineering Specialization) Introduction The Co-operative Education Program offers students the opportunity to combine their classroom experiences with related work experiences. Students who apply and are accepted into the Co-operative Education Program must successfully complete at least three paid work experiences interspersed throughout the four-year Honours program. The experience gained while participating in these structured and supervised work placements is viewed as an integral component of the student's educational program.\n\nUWindsor offers the Outstanding Scholars program for students to get involved in research projects. Student will get paid for each placement under the supervision of instructors. The program requires students to complete 6 placements in order to complete the OS program. Most students will start their placement from 3rd semester until the last semester to complete all 6 placements. Pros and Cons of Outstanding Scholars Pros Paid placement: $16.35/hour (2nd/3rd year) and $17.30/hour (4th year). Flexible total hours: 45-100 hours per placement. Great experience to put on resume or grad school application. A lot of machine learning and cyber security research projects focusing on different areas (ex. social network analysis and document and network analysis). Placements are not limited in your department. OS program is a golden key that can open any research doors for you. Outstanding Scholars Medal & Golden Maple Leaf Medallion will be awarded. Cons Time consuming. Depending on the research project, there is a lot of reading material. Depending on the research project, do not expect to code a lot. Unless you are buidling a training model for a machine learning algorithm or simulating model. Weekly or Bi-weekly meetings. Must keep close contact with professor with your progress. If your supervisor is too busy, and many of them are, then you are mostly on your own. That's why finding a good supervisor is very important.\n\n    Answer the student's query: what do programs offer?\n"

            "content": "\n    Consider the following context containing information about the Computer Science program at The University of Windsor: Last updated on 2023/10/15: The University of Windsor provides Co-Op options for both undergraduate honours and graduate computer science programs. Although it is an excellent opportunity for you to develop practical skills, you should consider the pros and cons of Co-Op and whether it is worthwhile for you. Here are some benefits you get from participating in the Co-Op program: 1. Work experience: you can get workplace experience while you're still in school. This will not only boost your resume, but also give you an idea what your career can look like after graduation. 2. Money: although wages vary from student to student, you will be paid for the work that you do during the work terms. 3. Network: you get to interact with other Co-Op students and professionals in your industry. This is an opportunity for you to develop your professional network and to learn about the career paths that you were not aware of. 4. Skills: from your employment, you will be able to develop technical and soft skills outside of the classroom environment. Co-Op is also a chance for you to find the in-demand skills in your career field. 4. Time management: during the Fall term of your second year, you will need to enroll in an extra class for Co-Op training (Transform module). You will also need to apply to job positions and interview for them during your study semesters prior to your work semesters. This is a way for you to practice managing your career and academic workload. When you are applying for post-graduation jobs during your last year, this skill will come handy to you. However, you should also consider some of the drawbacks of Co-Op: 1. Less time flexibility: you are required to enroll in full time studies (4 or more classes) in the semesters before and after a work term. If you want to change your sequence from the standard Co-Op sequence, you must make a schedule for the classes you will take for the rest of your program and get it approved by the Co-Op office. 2. Less academic flexibility: to maintain your position in Co-Op, you must maintain a cumulative average of 60%, major average of 65% and no more than one outstanding grade below 50%. 3. More fees: you must pay extra semesters of Co-Op fees during your enrollment (see the note below for more detail). Even when you withdraw from the program, you must continue to pay this fee for two more semesters. 4. You are graded: during your work semesters, you are expected to write reports, assessments, learning objectives and portfolios. These activities, along with your employer's evaluation of you, will be used to determine if you passed/failed this work term. NOTE: The total cost of your Co-Op fees is dependent on the number and length of your work terms. Standardly, domestic students pay $460 for 8 semesters ($3680 in total), and international students pay $570 for 8 semesters ($4560 in total). However, if your placement is 8 months long instead of 4 months, you will make 5 payments instead and thus pay less in total. Note that this amount is for 2023-2024 and may change for future semesters. After reading some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of Co-Op, perhaps you are able to have a better picture on whether you should enroll in a Co-Op program. If you would like to have a deeper discussion about Co-Op, you can contact our current CSS Career Advisor, Borhan Saflo (email: saflob@uwindsor.ca), or our Work Integrated Learning Coordinator for STEM, Kyle Cacilhas (email: cacilhak@uwindsor.ca). Extra Readings: If you are interested in the Co-Op program, here are more resources from the Co-Op office that you can read into: 1. https://www.uwindsor.ca/coop-workplace-partnerships/ 2. https://www.uwindsor.ca/cces/1218/co-op-programs 3. https://www.uwindsor.ca/cces/ You can also look at your academic calendars for information and requirement for Co-Op programs specific to your department. For the Spring 2023 academic calendar, the Co-Op regulations for Computer Science students is on page 578: https://www.uwindsor.ca/secretariat/sites/uwindsor.ca.secretariat/files/undergraduate_calendar_spring_2023.pdf\n\nCO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION The Co-operative Education Program is available for the following degrees: Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours Applied Computing) Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Information Systems) Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Science with Software Engineering Specialization) Introduction The Co-operative Education Program offers students the opportunity to combine their classroom experiences with related work experiences. Students who apply and are accepted into the Co-operative Education Program must successfully complete at least three paid work experiences interspersed throughout the four-year Honours program. The experience gained while participating in these structured and supervised work placements is viewed as an integral component of the student's educational program.\n\nAll Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the University. The process of securing a Co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek Co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process facilitated by the Centre for Career Education. Academic Regulations Computer Science Co-op students must maintain full-time academic status and satisfy the following: (a) Must maintain a minimum average of 60%, and (b) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65%, (c) Must not have more than one grade below 50% on their transcript, and; (d) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65% during the one semester probation period. General Information Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for placement. In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed their work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the Co-op program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that work term.

It addresses some general information about being a student at the University of Windsor and provides resources specifically to help students succeed in computer science courses.  Getting Started at the University of Windsor  UWin Accounts Every student must have a UWin Account in order to access the university's online services. Instructions to set up your UWin account will be sent to your personal email after you've been accepted into a program at the university. You will be assigned a UWin ID and will create a password during this process; these will be used as your login information. Your UWindsor email will be yourUWinI@uwindsor.ca.  Online Services Some of the online services you can access using your UWin Account include:  UWinsite Student For browsing and enrolling in classes, viewing tuition and fees, accessing acedamic information, applying for scholarships, and more. See the UWinsite Guide for more details and help.  Brightspace The university's Learning Management System (LMS). It is used to view course material, submit coursework, review grades, and more.  Microsoft Office 365 All University of Windsor students have access to a full suite of Microsoft Office 365 tools and software, including Outlook for email services and OneDrive for 1 TB of free cloud storage. A Microsoft Account is automatically created using your UWindsor Email and UWin Account Password. See this FAQ for more details.  Enrolling in Courses  Which Courses to Take :::important These wiki resources are maintained by student contributors. Always verify important academic information with a primary university resource or an academic advisor. ::: There are several computer science programs offered by the University of Windsor, each with their own course requirements which can be found in the undergraduate calendar. If you follow the recommended course sequence, many programs will share the same courses for the first term. They are COMP1000, COMP1400, MATH1250 (or MATH1260), MATH1720 (or MATH1760), and an elective. See the Courses section for a userfriendly table of course requirements by program.  How to Enroll Incoming first year students typically have the earliest appointment time and may enroll in courses before all other students. Your appointment time can be found on UWinsite under My Academics > Enrollment Deadlines. It is recommended to enroll as early as possible, as courses have a limited capacity and desireable timeslots fill up quickly. See the UWinsite Guide for more details on how to enroll in classes.  Recommended Software for Computer Science As a computer science student, you will learn to program in a variety of programming languages, starting with the C Programming Language in COMP1400. Installing and familiarizing yourself with the necessary software on your personal computer before the first day of classes will save you time and stress, especially if you are new to programming. All of the following software can be downloaded for free.  Code Editor: Visual Studio Code  Description A code editor helps a programmer write code (like Microsoft Word but for programming). Code can be written in any text editor, but a good code editor will provide features like syntax highlighting, basic error checking, and autocompletion for several programming languages. Note that a code editor is not an IDE (integrated development environment). For example, Visual Studio is an IDE while Visual Studio Code is a code editor and a seperate piece of software. An IDE will typically provide builtin tools to run, debug, and examine your code for a specific language, while a code editor will not (or will require you to install additional tools to do so).\n\nBachelor of Computer Science (General) Degree Requirements Total courses: thirty. (a) COMP-1000, COMP-1400, COMP-1410, COMP-2120, COMP-2540, COMP-2560, COMP-2650, COMP2660, COMP-3150, COMP-3220, COMP-3300, COMP-3340 (or COMP-3670), plus two additional Computer Science courses (excluding COMP-XXX7). (b) MATH-1250 (or MATH-1260), MATH-1720 (or MATH-1760), and STAT-2910; (c) one course from Arts/Languages, and one from Social Sciences; (d) eleven other courses from any area of study, including Computer Science. The major average will be calculated on the basis of the grades obtained in COMP-1000, COMP-1400, COMP-1410, COMP-2120, COMP-2540, COMP-2560, COMP-2650, COMP-2660, COMP-3150, COMP-3220, COMP-3300, and either COMP-3340 or COMP-3670 or both.

Registering in your Classes Registration at UWindsor is by appointment time. Registration appointment times are assigned based on a number of factors including program and level of study. Your registration appointment time is assigned based on several factors including program and level of study. Your registration appointment time is when you can start to register. It is important to register early to have a better chance of getting into the classes that you want to take. Registration does, however, remain open until the tenth day of classes so you may make changes to your courses so long as there is space. Once registration appointment times are assigned for a term, you can find yours under My Academics > Enrolment Deadlines. Your registration appointment time will also be sent to your UWindsor email account. When your registration appointment time opens:\n\nCourse overload is taking more courses in a term than the usual prescribed number. In the Fall and Winter terms, this means taking more than 5 courses per term. In the Intersession and Summer terms, this means taking more than 3 courses per term and more than 5 courses total. Students who have major and cumulative averages of 85% or higher may take one course on overload per term. Students with averages below this must obtain permission for course overload from the Associate Dean, Academic and Student Success. Please note that approval for course overload will only be granted in exceptional circumstances. (Source) How to Course Overload For CS students, the process of overloading is simple: Contact Tina Palmer at csinfo@uwindsor.ca. State that you'd like to course overload for the upcoming term and she'll give you a form to have filled out. Once you have the form, you'll need to fill out the relevant information about yourself and the course you'd like to overload with. Now, you must email the form to the professor of the course you'd like to overload with. They must sign the form and then hand it back off to Tina. Once the form is sent back to Tina, you've officially done all you need. From there, your form will be approved by a CS advisor as well as the Associate Dean of Science, before finally being processed by Registrars. After Registrars, you'll be added to the overloaded class! Why Course Overload You may be wondering why someome might want to course overload. Indeed, for most students 5 classes in a semester is more enough. However, overloading does have some advantages that might make it worth it if you're up to it: The cost increase of going from 5 classes in a semester to 6 classes in a semester is negligible. It's almost like you get a free class. Some courses are only offered at specific times in the year, so overloading may help prevent you from having to delay your graduation due to unfulfilled requirements. If you've ever dropped/VWd from a class, you may be slightly behind in your course sequencing. Overloading may help you get back on track. Overloading multiple semesters in a row, in conjunction with taking some summer courses, may help you graduate sooner. Helpful Tips Make sure the course you're overloading is a CS course. If you're taking at least one CS course in your overloaded semester, I'd recommend making that the course you overload. This is because different departments handle overloading differently, and you're more likely to have success dealing with the CS department. Additionally, if you're going to be taking multiple CS courses in a semester, choose a course with a professor you have a good relationship with to be your overloaded class. Since you need their consent to overload in their class, choosing which course to overload based on the professor teaching it is your best bet. Make sure all your fees are paid up on UWinsite before trying to overload. They won't let you enroll if you have an outstanding balance. Make sure you're comfortable with the workload of 6+ courses. Be prepared to either increase the amount of time you spend on school or lower your grade expectations.\n\n    Answer the student's query: How should I select a course?\n"

Students who apply and are accepted into the Co-operative Education Program must successfully complete at least three paid work experiences interspersed throughout the four-year Honours program. The experience gained while participating in these structured and supervised work placements is viewed as an integral component of the student's educational program.\n\nAll Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the University. The process of securing a Co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek Co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process facilitated by the Centre for Career Education. Academic Regulations Computer Science Co-op students must maintain full-time academic status and satisfy the following: (a) Must maintain a minimum average of 60%, and (b) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65%, (c) Must not have more than one grade below 50% on their transcript, and; (d) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65% during the one semester probation period. General Information Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for placement. In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed their work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the Co-op program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that work term. Sequence of Work and Study Terms Year of Study Fall Semester Winter Semester Summer Semester Year 1 Study Study Off Year 2 Study Study Work Year 3 Study Work Study Year 4 Work Study Work Year 5 Study \n\nLast updated on 2023/10/15: The University of Windsor provides Co-Op options for both undergraduate honours and graduate computer science programs. Although it is an excellent opportunity for you to develop practical skills, you should consider the pros and cons of Co-Op and whether it is worthwhile for you. Here are some benefits you get from participating in the Co-Op program: 1. Work experience: you can get workplace experience while you're still in school. This will not only boost your resume, but also give you an idea what your career can look like after graduation. 2. Money: although wages vary from student to student, you will be paid for the work that you do during the work terms. 3. Network: you get to interact with other Co-Op students and professionals in your industry. This is an opportunity for you to develop your professional network and to learn about the career paths that you were not aware of. 4. Skills: from your employment, you will be able to develop technical and soft skills outside of the classroom environment. Co-Op is also a chance for you to find the in-demand skills in your career field. 4. Time management: during the Fall term of your second year, you will need to enroll in an extra class for Co-Op training (Transform module). You will also need to apply to job positions and interview for them during your study semesters prior to your work semesters. This is a way for you to practice managing your career and academic workload. When you are applying for post-graduation jobs during your last year, this skill will come handy to you. However, you should also consider some of the drawbacks of Co-Op: 1. Less time flexibility: you are required to enroll in full time studies (4 or more classes) in the semesters before and after a work term. If you want to change your sequence from the standard Co-Op sequence, you must make a schedule for the classes you will take for the rest of your program and get it approved by the Co-Op office. 2. Less academic flexibility: to maintain your position in Co-Op, you must maintain a cumulative average of 60%, major average of 65% and no more than one outstanding grade below 50%. 3. More fees: you must pay extra semesters of Co-Op fees during your enrollment (see the note below for more detail). Even when you withdraw from the program, you must continue to pay this fee for two more semesters. 4. You are graded: during your work semesters, you are expected to write reports, assessments, learning objectives and portfolios. These activities, along with your employer's evaluation of you, will be used to determine if you passed/failed this work term. NOTE: The total cost of your Co-Op fees is dependent on the number and length of your work terms. Standardly, domestic students pay $460 for 8 semesters ($3680 in total), and international students pay $570 for 8 semesters ($4560 in total). However, if your placement is 8 months long instead of 4 months, you will make 5 payments instead and thus pay less in total.

Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term.

Although it is an excellent opportunity for you to develop practical skills, you should consider the pros and cons of Co-Op and whether it is worthwhile for you. Here are some benefits you get from participating in the Co-Op program: 1. Work experience: you can get workplace experience while you're still in school. This will not only boost your resume, but also give you an idea what your career can look like after graduation. 2. Money: although wages vary from student to student, you will be paid for the work that you do during the work terms. 3. Network: you get to interact with other Co-Op students and professionals in your industry. This is an opportunity for you to develop your professional network and to learn about the career paths that you were not aware of. 4. Skills: from your employment, you will be able to develop technical and soft skills outside of the classroom environment. Co-Op is also a chance for you to find the in-demand skills in your career field. 4. Time management: during the Fall term of your second year, you will need to enroll in an extra class for Co-Op training (Transform module). You will also need to apply to job positions and interview for them during your study semesters prior to your work semesters. This is a way for you to practice managing your career and academic workload. When you are applying for post-graduation jobs during your last year, this skill will come handy to you. However, you should also consider some of the drawbacks of Co-Op: 1. Less time flexibility: you are required to enroll in full time studies (4 or more classes) in the semesters before and after a work term. If you want to change your sequence from the standard Co-Op sequence, you must make a schedule for the classes you will take for the rest of your program and get it approved by the Co-Op office. 2. Less academic flexibility: to maintain your position in Co-Op, you must maintain a cumulative average of 60%, major average of 65% and no more than one outstanding grade below 50%. 3. More fees: you must pay extra semesters of Co-Op fees during your enrollment (see the note below for more detail). Even when you withdraw from the program, you must continue to pay this fee for two more semesters. 4. You are graded: during your work semesters, you are expected to write reports, assessments, learning objectives and portfolios. These activities, along with your employer's evaluation of you, will be used to determine if you passed/failed this work term. NOTE: The total cost of your Co-Op fees is dependent on the number and length of your work terms. Standardly, domestic students pay $460 for 8 semesters ($3680 in total), and international students pay $570 for 8 semesters ($4560 in total). However, if your placement is 8 months long instead of 4 months, you will make 5 payments instead and thus pay less in total.

It has an integrated job board with tons of internships. Intern Supply, though the links are usually broken. It can serve as a master list of fantastic companies that offer internships. Work In Tech has an extensive list of job opportunities, though most of them are not internships. Pitt-CSC (link: https://github.com/pittcsc) has a giant open source repo that tracks open CS internships for a lot of companies. The organization had a repo for new grad roles, but it is no longer maintained. A current version is maintained by coderQuad (link: https://github.com/coderQuad/New-Grad-Positions-2023). WARNING: Co-op has been known to decline winter internship offers for second-year students because they haven't completed their co-op course training. If you wish to have a winter internship before you have done your co-op course training, make sure it is one that doesn't go through co-op.\n\nAll Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the University. The process of securing a Co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek Co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process facilitated by the Centre for Career Education. Academic Regulations Computer Science Co-op students must maintain full-time academic status and satisfy the following: (a) Must maintain a minimum average of 60%, and (b) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65%, (c) Must not have more than one grade below 50% on their transcript, and; (d) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65% during the one semester probation period. General Information Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for placement. In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed their work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the Co-op program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that work term. Sequence of Work and Study Terms Year of Study Fall Semester Winter Semester Summer Semester Year 1 Study Study Off Year 2 Study Study Work Year 3 Study Work Study Year 4 Work Study Work Year 5 Study \n\nLast updated on 2023/10/15: The University of Windsor provides Co-Op options for both undergraduate honours and graduate computer science programs. Although it is an excellent opportunity for you to develop practical skills, you should consider the pros and cons of Co-Op and whether it is worthwhile for you. Here are some benefits you get from participating in the Co-Op program: 1. Work experience: you can get workplace experience while you're still in school. This will not only boost your resume, but also give you an idea what your career can look like after graduation. 2. Money: although wages vary from student to student, you will be paid for the work that you do during the work terms. 3. Network: you get to interact with other Co-Op students and professionals in your industry. This is an opportunity for you to develop your professional network and to learn about the career paths that you were not aware of. 4. Skills: from your employment, you will be able to develop technical and soft skills outside of the classroom environment. Co-Op is also a chance for you to find the in-demand skills in your career field. 4. Time management: during the Fall term of your second year, you will need to enroll in an extra class for Co-Op training (Transform module). You will also need to apply to job positions and interview for them during your study semesters prior to your work semesters. This is a way for you to practice managing your career and academic workload. When you are applying for post-graduation jobs during your last year, this skill will come handy to you. However, you should also consider some of the drawbacks of Co-Op: 1. Less time flexibility: you are required to enroll in full time studies (4 or more classes) in the semesters before and after a work term. If you want to change your sequence from the standard Co-Op sequence, you must make a schedule for the classes you will take for the rest of your program and get it approved by the Co-Op office. 2. Less academic flexibility: to maintain your position in Co-Op, you must maintain a cumulative average of 60%, major average of 65% and no more than one outstanding grade below 50%. 3. More fees: you must pay extra semesters of Co-Op fees during your enrollment (see the note below for more detail). Even when you withdraw from the program, you must continue to pay this fee for two more semesters. 4. You are graded: during your work semesters, you are expected to write reports, assessments, learning objectives and portfolios. These activities, along with your employer's evaluation of you, will be used to determine if you passed/failed this work term. NOTE: The total cost of your Co-Op fees is dependent on the number and length of your work terms. Standardly, domestic students pay $460 for 8 semesters ($3680 in total), and international students pay $570 for 8 semesters ($4560 in total). However, if your placement is 8 months long instead of 4 months, you will make 5 payments instead and thus pay less in total. Note that this amount is for 2023-2024 and may change for future semesters. After reading some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of Co-Op, perhaps you are able to have a better picture on whether you should enroll in a Co-Op program. If you would like to have a deeper discussion about Co-Op, you can contact our current CSS Career Advisor, Borhan Saflo (email: saflob@uwindsor.ca), or our Work Integrated Learning Coordinator for STEM, Kyle Cacilhas (email: cacilhak@uwindsor.ca).

Answer: The co-op program does not start until the summer of your 2nd year; however, you can apply to internships on your own in 1st year. You should try to apply to places in 1st year, you have nothing to lose! Q: What is the difference between a co-op and internship? Answer: Co-op and internship jobs are usually very similar. They're both short-term jobs. Co-ops are usually landed through the co-op program, whereas for internships you apply to them like a normal job (i.e. find postings online and apply). See the Co-Op Versus Internship section for more details. Q: Should I pay for co-op or just go for internships? Answer: Do both! Apply for internships and use co-op as a fallback. Once you've gotten your first co-op/internship it's significantly easier to get the next one on your own, and many people outgrow the co-op program. Q: Can I apply for internships while in the co-op program? Answer: Co-op advisors advise against applying without their permission, but in the end there's nothing stopping you from applying for internships on your own. If you find one by yourself and want to stay in the co-op program, co-op will gladly accept that company as a co-op placement after a little screening. Q: Do grades matter? Answer: For most co-op applications you must submit your transcript. Smaller/local companies may look at grades. However, for internships, you will not need to submit your transcript for 99% of applications.\n\n    Answer the student's query: Can I withdraw from a co-op program\n"

Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the Co-op program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that work term.

Although it is an excellent opportunity for you to develop practical skills, you should consider the pros and cons of Co-Op and whether it is worthwhile for you. Here are some benefits you get from participating in the Co-Op program: 1. Work experience: you can get workplace experience while you're still in school. This will not only boost your resume, but also give you an idea what your career can look like after graduation. 2. Money: although wages vary from student to student, you will be paid for the work that you do during the work terms. 3. Network: you get to interact with other Co-Op students and professionals in your industry. This is an opportunity for you to develop your professional network and to learn about the career paths that you were not aware of. 4. Skills: from your employment, you will be able to develop technical and soft skills outside of the classroom environment. Co-Op is also a chance for you to find the in-demand skills in your career field. 4. Time management: during the Fall term of your second year, you will need to enroll in an extra class for Co-Op training (Transform module). You will also need to apply to job positions and interview for them during your study semesters prior to your work semesters. This is a way for you to practice managing your career and academic workload. When you are applying for post-graduation jobs during your last year, this skill will come handy to you. However, you should also consider some of the drawbacks of Co-Op: 1. Less time flexibility: you are required to enroll in full time studies (4 or more classes) in the semesters before and after a work term. If you want to change your sequence from the standard Co-Op sequence, you must make a schedule for the classes you will take for the rest of your program and get it approved by the Co-Op office. 2. Less academic flexibility: to maintain your position in Co-Op, you must maintain a cumulative average of 60%, major average of 65% and no more than one outstanding grade below 50%. 3. More fees: you must pay extra semesters of Co-Op fees during your enrollment (see the note below for more detail). Even when you withdraw from the program, you must continue to pay this fee for two more semesters. 4. You are graded: during your work semesters, you are expected to write reports, assessments, learning objectives and portfolios. These activities, along with your employer's evaluation of you, will be used to determine if you passed/failed this work term. NOTE: The total cost of your Co-Op fees is dependent on the number and length of your work terms. Standardly, domestic students pay $460 for 8 semesters ($3680 in total), and international students pay $570 for 8 semesters ($4560 in total). However, if your placement is 8 months long instead of 4 months, you will make 5 payments instead and thus pay less in total. Note that this amount is for 2023-2024 and may change for future semesters. After reading some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of Co-Op, perhaps you are able to have a better picture on whether you should enroll in a Co-Op program. If you would like to have a deeper discussion about Co-Op, you can contact our current CSS Career Advisor, Borhan Saflo (email: saflob@uwindsor.ca), or our Work Integrated Learning Coordinator for STEM, Kyle Cacilhas (email: cacilhak@uwindsor.ca).

            "content": "\n    Consider the following context containing information about the Computer Science program at The University of Windsor: All Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the University. The process of securing a Co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek Co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process facilitated by the Centre for Career Education. Academic Regulations Computer Science Co-op students must maintain full-time academic status and satisfy the following: (a) Must maintain a minimum average of 60%, and (b) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65%, (c) Must not have more than one grade below 50% on their transcript, and; (d) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65% during the one semester probation period. General Information Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for placement. In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed their work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the Co-op program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that work term. Sequence of Work and Study Terms Year of Study Fall Semester Winter Semester Summer Semester Year 1 Study Study Off Year 2 Study Study Work Year 3 Study Work Study Year 4 Work Study Work Year 5 Study \n\nLast updated on 2023/10/15: The University of Windsor provides Co-Op options for both undergraduate honours and graduate computer science programs. Although it is an excellent opportunity for you to develop practical skills, you should consider the pros and cons of Co-Op and whether it is worthwhile for you. Here are some benefits you get from participating in the Co-Op program: 1. Work experience: you can get workplace experience while you're still in school. This will not only boost your resume, but also give you an idea what your career can look like after graduation. 2. Money: although wages vary from student to student, you will be paid for the work that you do during the work terms. 3. Network: you get to interact with other Co-Op students and professionals in your industry. This is an opportunity for you to develop your professional network and to learn about the career paths that you were not aware of. 4. Skills: from your employment, you will be able to develop technical and soft skills outside of the classroom environment. Co-Op is also a chance for you to find the in-demand skills in your career field. 4. Time management: during the Fall term of your second year, you will need to enroll in an extra class for Co-Op training (Transform module). You will also need to apply to job positions and interview for them during your study semesters prior to your work semesters. This is a way for you to practice managing your career and academic workload. When you are applying for post-graduation jobs during your last year, this skill will come handy to you. However, you should also consider some of the drawbacks of Co-Op: 1. Less time flexibility: you are required to enroll in full time studies (4 or more classes) in the semesters before and after a work term. If you want to change your sequence from the standard Co-Op sequence, you must make a schedule for the classes you will take for the rest of your program and get it approved by the Co-Op office. 2. Less academic flexibility: to maintain your position in Co-Op, you must maintain a cumulative average of 60%, major average of 65% and no more than one outstanding grade below 50%. 3. More fees: you must pay extra semesters of Co-Op fees during your enrollment (see the note below for more detail). Even when you withdraw from the program, you must continue to pay this fee for two more semesters. 4. You are graded: during your work semesters, you are expected to write reports, assessments, learning objectives and portfolios. These activities, along with your employer's evaluation of you, will be used to determine if you passed/failed this work term. NOTE: The total cost of your Co-Op fees is dependent on the number and length of your work terms. Standardly, domestic students pay $460 for 8 semesters ($3680 in total), and international students pay $570 for 8 semesters ($4560 in total). However, if your placement is 8 months long instead of 4 months, you will make 5 payments instead and thus pay less in total. Note that this amount is for 2023-2024 and may change for future semesters. After reading some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of Co-Op, perhaps you are able to have a better picture on whether you should enroll in a Co-Op program. If you would like to have a deeper discussion about Co-Op, you can contact our current CSS Career Advisor, Borhan Saflo (email: saflob@uwindsor.ca), or our Work Integrated Learning Coordinator for STEM, Kyle Cacilhas (email: cacilhak@uwindsor.ca). Extra Readings: If you are interested in the Co-Op program, here are more resources from the Co-Op office that you can read into: 1. https://www.uwindsor.ca/coop-workplace-partnerships/ 2. https://www.uwindsor.ca/cces/1218/co-op-programs 3. https://www.uwindsor.ca/cces/ You can also look at your academic calendars for information and requirement for Co-Op programs specific to your department. For the Spring 2023 academic calendar, the Co-Op regulations for Computer Science students is on page 578: https://www.uwindsor.ca/secretariat/sites/uwindsor.ca.secretariat/files/undergraduate_calendar_spring_2023.pdf\n\nCO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION The Co-operative Education Program is available for the following degrees: Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours Applied Computing) Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Information Systems) Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Science with Software Engineering Specialization) Introduction The Co-operative Education Program offers students the opportunity to combine their classroom experiences with related work experiences.

SELECTION OF COURSES In selecting courses to meet the requirements of the programs outlined below, the following general regulations also must be observed: 1) A student registering in a course without having successfully completed the prerequisite course(s) will be required to drop that course unless the consent of the Director of Computer Science (or her/his designate) is obtained. 2) If two or more courses cover essentially the same material, only one may be taken for credit. 3) The prior approval of the Director of Computer Science (or her/his designate) must be obtained in order to substitute any courses for required ones. 4) Statistics courses other than those specifically listed as being required for the degree, or ones for which the required statistics courses are themselves prerequisites, may not be taken for credit. 5) In general, Computer Science courses offered in other areas may not be taken for credit. COMP-1047, COMP-2067, COMP-2057, COMP-2077, COMP-2707, and COMP-3057 may not be used to satisfy the major requirements of any degree program in Computer Science, or in joint programs with Computer Science, unless permission is obtained from the Director of Computer Science (or her/his designate). \n\n    Answer the student's query: What programs are required in order to get into a graduate program?\n"

            "content": "\n    Consider the following context containing information about the Computer Science program at The University of Windsor: Course overload is taking more courses in a term than the usual prescribed number. In the Fall and Winter terms, this means taking more than 5 courses per term. In the Intersession and Summer terms, this means taking more than 3 courses per term and more than 5 courses total. Students who have major and cumulative averages of 85% or higher may take one course on overload per term. Students with averages below this must obtain permission for course overload from the Associate Dean, Academic and Student Success. Please note that approval for course overload will only be granted in exceptional circumstances. (Source) How to Course Overload For CS students, the process of overloading is simple: Contact Tina Palmer at csinfo@uwindsor.ca. State that you'd like to course overload for the upcoming term and she'll give you a form to have filled out. Once you have the form, you'll need to fill out the relevant information about yourself and the course you'd like to overload with. Now, you must email the form to the professor of the course you'd like to overload with. They must sign the form and then hand it back off to Tina. Once the form is sent back to Tina, you've officially done all you need. From there, your form will be approved by a CS advisor as well as the Associate Dean of Science, before finally being processed by Registrars. After Registrars, you'll be added to the overloaded class! Why Course Overload You may be wondering why someome might want to course overload. Indeed, for most students 5 classes in a semester is more enough. However, overloading does have some advantages that might make it worth it if you're up to it: The cost increase of going from 5 classes in a semester to 6 classes in a semester is negligible. It's almost like you get a free class. Some courses are only offered at specific times in the year, so overloading may help prevent you from having to delay your graduation due to unfulfilled requirements. If you've ever dropped/VWd from a class, you may be slightly behind in your course sequencing. Overloading may help you get back on track. Overloading multiple semesters in a row, in conjunction with taking some summer courses, may help you graduate sooner. Helpful Tips Make sure the course you're overloading is a CS course. If you're taking at least one CS course in your overloaded semester, I'd recommend making that the course you overload. This is because different departments handle overloading differently, and you're more likely to have success dealing with the CS department. Additionally, if you're going to be taking multiple CS courses in a semester, choose a course with a professor you have a good relationship with to be your overloaded class. Since you need their consent to overload in their class, choosing which course to overload based on the professor teaching it is your best bet. Make sure all your fees are paid up on UWinsite before trying to overload. They won't let you enroll if you have an outstanding balance. Make sure you're comfortable with the workload of 6+ courses. Be prepared to either increase the amount of time you spend on school or lower your grade expectations.\n\nBachelor of Computer Science (General) for University Graduates Admission Requirements (i) A three-year General, four-year Major or four-year Honours degree from an accredited University (in a discipline other than Computer Science).

However, regardless if you are an OS Candidate or not, you must apply again after your first year in order to enter the OS program as a full scholar and perform research. Applying to be an Outstanding Scholar Candidate: High school students can apply to the OS Candidates Scholarship. The selected students for this scholarship will be known as OS Candidates. During their first year, OS Candidates will receive $750 / semester, interact with other Outstanding Scholars, and have opportunities to network with professors. After their first year at the University of Windsor, OS Candidates need to re-apply to the OS Program to formally get involved with research projects. The application will be done through the Student Awards Profile at UWinsite Student, and the top 100 students applying for admission to any first-entry program at the University of Windsor will be accepted. Students are eligible to apply if their GPA, based on the top three to six Grade 12 U/M courses, is least 85%. The deadline for applications for Fall 2022 admission will be Thursday, March 31st, 2022. Applying to be a Full-fledged Outstanding Scholar: Every summer, invitations will be given out to prospective second-years to apply to the OS program to become a full scholar. Invitations will be given by email to the top 250 first-year students with the highest cumulative GPA. If a student is already an OS Candidate, then they will be invited if they are in good academic standing and has maintained a cumulative average of 80%+. Every year, the OS program will admit the top 80 second-year students as Outstanding Scholars. These Outstanding Scholars will start to find their research placement during the Fall semester of their second year. Students are eligible to apply if their cumulative GPA ranks among the top 250 first-year students. If a student is already an OS Candidate, then they will be invited if they are in good academic standing and has maintained a cumulative average of 80%+. NOTE If you complete only 9 courses for 2 semesters in first year, then you will not receive an invitation to apply for the program. However, do not worry! you can contact Dr. Tim Brunet to inform him about your interests in the program. To graduate as an OS student, you must complete 6 placements, which is 6 semesters or 3 years of your study. If you have completed more than 10 courses, you won't be able to meet the requirement. However, if you plan to take extra summer courses and do a research placement, then you are eligible to apply. Contact Dr. Tim Brunet and explain your goal to complete the program. Selection Criteria for Outstanding Scholars Academic accomplishments: GPA 85% or higher (high school) / top 250 cumulative GPA (second-year). Evident desire to do research or original creative work. Evidence of community service. Leadership, through excellence in athletic, creative, or other fields, or through serving in a formal leadership role. Specific research project that you are interested in. A reference letter from a faculty member or instructor. To get a greate reference letter, you could get to know more about a professor's research project during their office hours. This will show that you are curious and willing to learn. They will put a good word in for you.\n\nBachelor of Computer Science (General) for University Graduates Admission Requirements (i) A three-year General, four-year Major or four-year Honours degree from an accredited University (in a discipline other than Computer Science).

These students should consult a program advisor. \n\nCourse overload is taking more courses in a term than the usual prescribed number. In the Fall and Winter terms, this means taking more than 5 courses per term. In the Intersession and Summer terms, this means taking more than 3 courses per term and more than 5 courses total. Students who have major and cumulative averages of 85% or higher may take one course on overload per term. Students with averages below this must obtain permission for course overload from the Associate Dean, Academic and Student Success. Please note that approval for course overload will only be granted in exceptional circumstances. (Source) How to Course Overload For CS students, the process of overloading is simple: Contact Tina Palmer at csinfo@uwindsor.ca. State that you'd like to course overload for the upcoming term and she'll give you a form to have filled out. Once you have the form, you'll need to fill out the relevant information about yourself and the course you'd like to overload with. Now, you must email the form to the professor of the course you'd like to overload with. They must sign the form and then hand it back off to Tina. Once the form is sent back to Tina, you've officially done all you need. From there, your form will be approved by a CS advisor as well as the Associate Dean of Science, before finally being processed by Registrars. After Registrars, you'll be added to the overloaded class! Why Course Overload You may be wondering why someome might want to course overload. Indeed, for most students 5 classes in a semester is more enough. However, overloading does have some advantages that might make it worth it if you're up to it: The cost increase of going from 5 classes in a semester to 6 classes in a semester is negligible. It's almost like you get a free class. Some courses are only offered at specific times in the year, so overloading may help prevent you from having to delay your graduation due to unfulfilled requirements. If you've ever dropped/VWd from a class, you may be slightly behind in your course sequencing. Overloading may help you get back on track. Overloading multiple semesters in a row, in conjunction with taking some summer courses, may help you graduate sooner. Helpful Tips Make sure the course you're overloading is a CS course. If you're taking at least one CS course in your overloaded semester, I'd recommend making that the course you overload. This is because different departments handle overloading differently, and you're more likely to have success dealing with the CS department. Additionally, if you're going to be taking multiple CS courses in a semester, choose a course with a professor you have a good relationship with to be your overloaded class. Since you need their consent to overload in their class, choosing which course to overload based on the professor teaching it is your best bet. Make sure all your fees are paid up on UWinsite before trying to overload. They won't let you enroll if you have an outstanding balance. Make sure you're comfortable with the workload of 6+ courses. Be prepared to either increase the amount of time you spend on school or lower your grade expectations.\n\nBachelor of Science (Honours Computer Information Systems) This program is available with or without Co-op.

If your country of destination allows international students to do parttime work, you may also work during exchange to cover a part of your expenses.  Application Process Students interested in applying must have these components in their application:  Exchange Online Application  Three Reference Letters/Forms   The form must be completed and returned by the references, not the student.   One of the three references must be a UWindsor faculty member who has taught the student in a class.  Language Assessment (if applicable) After applying, you may be interviewed by the Exchange Office to determine your interest in the exchange program. The Exchange Office has a selection committee who will review the applications, interview the applicants, and rank candidates based on the following criteria:  Seriousness of interest   This can be demonstrated in the depth of research you showcase about the school(s) you applied for.  Suitability of the host institution\u2019s program for degree requirements  Ability to be a good ambassador and representative of the University and the city while away  Interesting classes you noted when making your application for exchange   You are not expected to make a class schedule when applying for exchange, but this is a nice bonus point.  Personal adaptability  Participation in university and community life  Academic ability The interview may be conducted in a second language if the school(s) you applied for does not teach in English. In addition, the interview is a great opportunity for you to ask some questions you have about the exchange.  Important Deadline :::important You should send in your complete application (including the language assessment and reference forms to be sent by the references) before the specified deadline to get priority when considered for exchange placements. Although late applications are still accepted, late applicants are only considered when there is remaining space and time. :::  January 15th (before 3 pm)  application deadline for students beginning exchange in September (1 or 2 semesters)   Applications are usually available around midOctober.  September 15th (before 3 pm)  application deadline for students beginning exchange in January (1 semester)   Applications are usually available around late June. Generally, students are recommended to apply during their second year and begin exchange during their third year to allow for flexibility in course selection when studying abroad. To ensure that your graduation is not delayed, you should consult with your academic department/advisor about the interest you have for the exchange program. :::note Students going on exchange in their final semester may have their convocation delayed due to the time needed to process transfer credits.\n\n    Answer the student's query: When do course registration open\n"

This section goes into detail regarding your term and when you're expected to graduate.\n\nAll Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the University. The process of securing a Co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek Co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process facilitated by the Centre for Career Education. Academic Regulations Computer Science Co-op students must maintain full-time academic status and satisfy the following: (a) Must maintain a minimum average of 60%, and (b) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65%, (c) Must not have more than one grade below 50% on their transcript, and; (d) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65% during the one semester probation period. General Information Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for placement. In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed their work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the Co-op program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that work term.

Course Management  How to Plan & Enroll in Classes To plan your courses and register in classes in UWinsite Student, you will use the Manage Classes section on the Student Homepage.  Planning your Classes You can start planning your classes and adding them to your Shopping Cart in UWinsite Student when the validation period opens. The validation period is when the timetable for the next semester is close to final and the courses being offered are visible in UWinsite Student. Typically, the validation period starts two to three weeks before registration begins. The preferred method for placing your classes into the Shopping Cart is through Class Search and Enroll. This method shows you just the courses that are offered during the term for which you are planning. To get started planning your classes: UWinsite homepage 1. On the Student Homepage, click the Manage Classes tile. 2. Click the Class Search & Enroll tab in the left navigation menu.  Class search and enroll page 3. Select the term in which you will be registering. 4. In the Search for Classes field, enter a subject area, topic or course code. 5. From the Search Results, select a course. 6. On the Course Information page you will see all class sections for the term you  selected. Some classes have one section while others have multiple sections. Under  Class Selection, you can view the time, date, instructor, location and available seats  for each section of the class.  Course info and class selection page 7. Select a class section. You can click anywhere on the class except for the Lecture or  Lab link to select it. 8. You\u2019ll now be directed to the confirmation process:  1. Review Class Selection and click Next  2. Review Class Preferences   This is where you have the option to add yourself to the waitlist if the class is  full. Select Yes if this will not put you in course overload (normally 5 classes, but  check your program).   Select No if having this course on the waitlist would put you in course overload.  You will instead need to use Swap Classes so UWinsite Student knows what  course to drop if you are to reach the top of the waitlist.  3. Click Accept  4. On the Enroll or Add to Cart page, click the Add to Shopping Cart button and  then click Next.  5. On the Review and Submit page, review your selections and then click Submit.  Registering in your Classes Registration at UWindsor is by appointment time. Registration appointment times are assigned based on a number of factors including program and level of study. Your registration appointment time is assigned based on several factors including program and level of study. Your registration appointment time is when you can start to register. It is important to register early to have a better chance of getting into the classes that you want to take. Registration does, however, remain open until the tenth day of classes so you may make changes to your courses so long as there is space. Once registration appointment times are assigned for a term, you can find yours under My Academics > Enrolment Deadlines. Your registration appointment time will also be sent to your UWindsor email account. When your registration appointment time opens:\n\nOther Evaluation Procedures 2.5.1 No single evaluation in first-entry undergraduate programs can be worth more than 40% of the final grade, except for specific course types. If missed due to valid reasons, its weight can be added to the final evaluation. 2.5.2 Students with three or more final exams in 24 hours can request a reschedule. Decisions will be made by the Associate Vice-President, Student Experience. 2.5.3 Students with three or more major evaluations in 24 hours can request accommodation early in the term. 2.5.4 Unannounced quizzes must not exceed 2% each or 5% in total of the final grade. The number and value of spot quizzes must be communicated at the start of the semester. 2.6 Instructors must provide feedback worth at least 20% of the final grade two days before the withdrawal deadline. 2.7 Course outlines can be changed within the first two weeks of classes, with the final version submitted to the AAU Head. 2.8 If a test cannot be held due to an emergency, it will be rescheduled for the next regular class meeting. 2.9 If tests are scheduled outside regular class times, alternative arrangements must be made for students with conflicts or hardships. 2.10 Courses involving evaluations by observers must provide written evaluations during the semester and preserve records of major performances. 2.11 Students can resolve issues informally with the Instructor or AAU Head. If unresolved, they can appeal to the Dean. 2.12 Unofficial final grades must be submitted to the Dean within seven calendar days after the final exam or exam period, except in the Faculty of Law. 2.12.1 No public posting of exams, essays, or assignments. 2.12.2 Students have the right to review marking guides and final exams, which must be kept for at least twelve months. 2.13 Final grades are submitted by the Instructor through the AAU Head to the Dean, who then sends them to the Registrar. 2.14 Grade corrections can only be initiated by the Instructor and require signatures from the AAU Head and the Dean. 2.15 Students must withdraw within specified periods, with the withdrawal recorded as VW on their transcript. 2.16 Appeals must be made in writing within three weeks of the final mark's release, with responses due within four weeks.For JD program students, the three-week appeal period starts when they are notified of their marks.\n\nCourse overload is taking more courses in a term than the usual prescribed number. In the Fall and Winter terms, this means taking more than 5 courses per term. In the Intersession and Summer terms, this means taking more than 3 courses per term and more than 5 courses total. Students who have major and cumulative averages of 85% or higher may take one course on overload per term. Students with averages below this must obtain permission for course overload from the Associate Dean, Academic and Student Success. Please note that approval for course overload will only be granted in exceptional circumstances. (Source) How to Course Overload For CS students, the process of overloading is simple: Contact Tina Palmer at csinfo@uwindsor.ca. State that you'd like to course overload for the upcoming term and she'll give you a form to have filled out. Once you have the form, you'll need to fill out the relevant information about yourself and the course you'd like to overload with. Now, you must email the form to the professor of the course you'd like to overload with. They must sign the form and then hand it back off to Tina. Once the form is sent back to Tina, you've officially done all you need. From there, your form will be approved by a CS advisor as well as the Associate Dean of Science, before finally being processed by Registrars. After Registrars, you'll be added to the overloaded class! Why Course Overload You may be wondering why someome might want to course overload. Indeed, for most students 5 classes in a semester is more enough. However, overloading does have some advantages that might make it worth it if you're up to it: The cost increase of going from 5 classes in a semester to 6 classes in a semester is negligible. It's almost like you get a free class. Some courses are only offered at specific times in the year, so overloading may help prevent you from having to delay your graduation due to unfulfilled requirements. If you've ever dropped/VWd from a class, you may be slightly behind in your course sequencing. Overloading may help you get back on track. Overloading multiple semesters in a row, in conjunction with taking some summer courses, may help you graduate sooner. Helpful Tips Make sure the course you're overloading is a CS course. If you're taking at least one CS course in your overloaded semester, I'd recommend making that the course you overload. This is because different departments handle overloading differently, and you're more likely to have success dealing with the CS department. Additionally, if you're going to be taking multiple CS courses in a semester, choose a course with a professor you have a good relationship with to be your overloaded class. Since you need their consent to overload in their class, choosing which course to overload based on the professor teaching it is your best bet. Make sure all your fees are paid up on UWinsite before trying to overload. They won't let you enroll if you have an outstanding balance. Make sure you're comfortable with the workload of 6+ courses. Be prepared to either increase the amount of time you spend on school or lower your grade expectations.\n\n    Answer the student's query: Can I drop my classes during the semester\n"

The process of securing a Co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek Co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process facilitated by the Centre for Career Education. Academic Regulations Computer Science Co-op students must maintain full-time academic status and satisfy the following: (a) Must maintain a minimum average of 60%, and (b) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65%, (c) Must not have more than one grade below 50% on their transcript, and; (d) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65% during the one semester probation period. General Information Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for placement. In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed their work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the Co-op program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that work term.

The process of securing a Co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek Co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process facilitated by the Centre for Career Education. Academic Regulations Computer Science Co-op students must maintain full-time academic status and satisfy the following: (a) Must maintain a minimum average of 60%, and (b) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65%, (c) Must not have more than one grade below 50% on their transcript, and; (d) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65% during the one semester probation period. General Information Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for placement. In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed their work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the Co-op program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that work term.

Answer: The co-op program does not start until the summer of your 2nd year; however, you can apply to internships on your own in 1st year. You should try to apply to places in 1st year, you have nothing to lose! Q: What is the difference between a co-op and internship? Answer: Co-op and internship jobs are usually very similar. They're both short-term jobs. Co-ops are usually landed through the co-op program, whereas for internships you apply to them like a normal job (i.e. find postings online and apply). See the Co-Op Versus Internship section for more details. Q: Should I pay for co-op or just go for internships? Answer: Do both! Apply for internships and use co-op as a fallback. Once you've gotten your first co-op/internship it's significantly easier to get the next one on your own, and many people outgrow the co-op program. Q: Can I apply for internships while in the co-op program? Answer: Co-op advisors advise against applying without their permission, but in the end there's nothing stopping you from applying for internships on your own. If you find one by yourself and want to stay in the co-op program, co-op will gladly accept that company as a co-op placement after a little screening. Q: Do grades matter? Answer: For most co-op applications you must submit your transcript. Smaller/local companies may look at grades. However, for internships, you will not need to submit your transcript for 99% of applications.\n\nAll Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the University. The process of securing a Co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek Co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process facilitated by the Centre for Career Education. Academic Regulations Computer Science Co-op students must maintain full-time academic status and satisfy the following: (a) Must maintain a minimum average of 60%, and (b) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65%, (c) Must not have more than one grade below 50% on their transcript, and; (d) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65% during the one semester probation period. General Information Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for placement. In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed their work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the Co-op program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that work term. Sequence of Work and Study Terms Year of Study Fall Semester Winter Semester Summer Semester Year 1 Study Study Off Year 2 Study Study Work Year 3 Study Work Study Year 4 Work Study Work Year 5 Study \n\nLast updated on 2023/10/15: The University of Windsor provides Co-Op options for both undergraduate honours and graduate computer science programs. Although it is an excellent opportunity for you to develop practical skills, you should consider the pros and cons of Co-Op and whether it is worthwhile for you. Here are some benefits you get from participating in the Co-Op program: 1. Work experience: you can get workplace experience while you're still in school. This will not only boost your resume, but also give you an idea what your career can look like after graduation. 2. Money: although wages vary from student to student, you will be paid for the work that you do during the work terms. 3. Network: you get to interact with other Co-Op students and professionals in your industry. This is an opportunity for you to develop your professional network and to learn about the career paths that you were not aware of. 4. Skills: from your employment, you will be able to develop technical and soft skills outside of the classroom environment. Co-Op is also a chance for you to find the in-demand skills in your career field. 4. Time management: during the Fall term of your second year, you will need to enroll in an extra class for Co-Op training (Transform module). You will also need to apply to job positions and interview for them during your study semesters prior to your work semesters. This is a way for you to practice managing your career and academic workload. When you are applying for post-graduation jobs during your last year, this skill will come handy to you. However, you should also consider some of the drawbacks of Co-Op: 1. Less time flexibility: you are required to enroll in full time studies (4 or more classes) in the semesters before and after a work term. If you want to change your sequence from the standard Co-Op sequence, you must make a schedule for the classes you will take for the rest of your program and get it approved by the Co-Op office. 2. Less academic flexibility: to maintain your position in Co-Op, you must maintain a cumulative average of 60%, major average of 65% and no more than one outstanding grade below 50%. 3. More fees: you must pay extra semesters of Co-Op fees during your enrollment (see the note below for more detail). Even when you withdraw from the program, you must continue to pay this fee for two more semesters. 4. You are graded: during your work semesters, you are expected to write reports, assessments, learning objectives and portfolios. These activities, along with your employer's evaluation of you, will be used to determine if you passed/failed this work term. NOTE: The total cost of your Co-Op fees is dependent on the number and length of your work terms. Standardly, domestic students pay $460 for 8 semesters ($3680 in total), and international students pay $570 for 8 semesters ($4560 in total). However, if your placement is 8 months long instead of 4 months, you will make 5 payments instead and thus pay less in total. Note that this amount is for 2023-2024 and may change for future semesters. After reading some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of Co-Op, perhaps you are able to have a better picture on whether you should enroll in a Co-Op program. If you would like to have a deeper discussion about Co-Op, you can contact our current CSS Career Advisor, Borhan Saflo (email: saflob@uwindsor.ca), or our Work Integrated Learning Coordinator for STEM, Kyle Cacilhas (email: cacilhak@uwindsor.ca).

            "content": "\n    Consider the following context containing information about the Computer Science program at The University of Windsor: Q: Can I do an internship/co-op during my first year? Answer: The co-op program does not start until the summer of your 2nd year; however, you can apply to internships on your own in 1st year. You should try to apply to places in 1st year, you have nothing to lose! Q: What is the difference between a co-op and internship? Answer: Co-op and internship jobs are usually very similar. They're both short-term jobs. Co-ops are usually landed through the co-op program, whereas for internships you apply to them like a normal job (i.e. find postings online and apply). See the Co-Op Versus Internship section for more details. Q: Should I pay for co-op or just go for internships? Answer: Do both! Apply for internships and use co-op as a fallback. Once you've gotten your first co-op/internship it's significantly easier to get the next one on your own, and many people outgrow the co-op program. Q: Can I apply for internships while in the co-op program? Answer: Co-op advisors advise against applying without their permission, but in the end there's nothing stopping you from applying for internships on your own. If you find one by yourself and want to stay in the co-op program, co-op will gladly accept that company as a co-op placement after a little screening. Q: Do grades matter? Answer: For most co-op applications you must submit your transcript. Smaller/local companies may look at grades. However, for internships, you will not need to submit your transcript for 99% of applications.\n\nOther Evaluation Procedures 2.5.1 No single evaluation in first-entry undergraduate programs can be worth more than 40% of the final grade, except for specific course types. If missed due to valid reasons, its weight can be added to the final evaluation. 2.5.2 Students with three or more final exams in 24 hours can request a reschedule. Decisions will be made by the Associate Vice-President, Student Experience. 2.5.3 Students with three or more major evaluations in 24 hours can request accommodation early in the term. 2.5.4 Unannounced quizzes must not exceed 2% each or 5% in total of the final grade. The number and value of spot quizzes must be communicated at the start of the semester. 2.6 Instructors must provide feedback worth at least 20% of the final grade two days before the withdrawal deadline. 2.7 Course outlines can be changed within the first two weeks of classes, with the final version submitted to the AAU Head. 2.8 If a test cannot be held due to an emergency, it will be rescheduled for the next regular class meeting. 2.9 If tests are scheduled outside regular class times, alternative arrangements must be made for students with conflicts or hardships. 2.10 Courses involving evaluations by observers must provide written evaluations during the semester and preserve records of major performances. 2.11 Students can resolve issues informally with the Instructor or AAU Head. If unresolved, they can appeal to the Dean. 2.12 Unofficial final grades must be submitted to the Dean within seven calendar days after the final exam or exam period, except in the Faculty of Law. 2.12.1 No public posting of exams, essays, or assignments. 2.12.2 Students have the right to review marking guides and final exams, which must be kept for at least twelve months. 2.13 Final grades are submitted by the Instructor through the AAU Head to the Dean, who then sends them to the Registrar. 2.14 Grade corrections can only be initiated by the Instructor and require signatures from the AAU Head and the Dean. 2.15 Students must withdraw within specified periods, with the withdrawal recorded as VW on their transcript. 2.16 Appeals must be made in writing within three weeks of the final mark's release, with responses due within four weeks.For JD program students, the three-week appeal period starts when they are notified of their marks.\n\nHeader: Include your name, contact information, GitHub, Linkedin and your personal website (if you have one) Your name must be the largest font Education Put down the University you're studying at and the name of your program Include relevant coursework Only include your GPA if it's above a 90 Skills Refer to the job description and add essential keywords on your resume to increase your chance of getting an interview DO NOT simply list all the keywords on the job description for the sake of showing you\u2019re a good fit.

Experience Focus only on including work experience that has relevance to the job that you are applying for Keep your points brief and to the point Have various versions of your resume tailored for each job you are applying for. There is no one-size-fits-all resume. The most important thing is to describe what you've accomplished, not just what task you were assigned. Use the \u201cAccomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]\u201d formula. It\u2019s the most effective way of showing recruiters your impact.

Although it is an excellent opportunity for you to develop practical skills, you should consider the pros and cons of Co-Op and whether it is worthwhile for you. Here are some benefits you get from participating in the Co-Op program: 1. Work experience: you can get workplace experience while you're still in school. This will not only boost your resume, but also give you an idea what your career can look like after graduation. 2. Money: although wages vary from student to student, you will be paid for the work that you do during the work terms. 3. Network: you get to interact with other Co-Op students and professionals in your industry. This is an opportunity for you to develop your professional network and to learn about the career paths that you were not aware of. 4. Skills: from your employment, you will be able to develop technical and soft skills outside of the classroom environment. Co-Op is also a chance for you to find the in-demand skills in your career field. 4. Time management: during the Fall term of your second year, you will need to enroll in an extra class for Co-Op training (Transform module). You will also need to apply to job positions and interview for them during your study semesters prior to your work semesters. This is a way for you to practice managing your career and academic workload. When you are applying for post-graduation jobs during your last year, this skill will come handy to you. However, you should also consider some of the drawbacks of Co-Op: 1. Less time flexibility: you are required to enroll in full time studies (4 or more classes) in the semesters before and after a work term. If you want to change your sequence from the standard Co-Op sequence, you must make a schedule for the classes you will take for the rest of your program and get it approved by the Co-Op office. 2. Less academic flexibility: to maintain your position in Co-Op, you must maintain a cumulative average of 60%, major average of 65% and no more than one outstanding grade below 50%. 3. More fees: you must pay extra semesters of Co-Op fees during your enrollment (see the note below for more detail). Even when you withdraw from the program, you must continue to pay this fee for two more semesters. 4. You are graded: during your work semesters, you are expected to write reports, assessments, learning objectives and portfolios. These activities, along with your employer's evaluation of you, will be used to determine if you passed/failed this work term. NOTE: The total cost of your Co-Op fees is dependent on the number and length of your work terms. Standardly, domestic students pay $460 for 8 semesters ($3680 in total), and international students pay $570 for 8 semesters ($4560 in total). However, if your placement is 8 months long instead of 4 months, you will make 5 payments instead and thus pay less in total. Note that this amount is for 2023-2024 and may change for future semesters. After reading some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of Co-Op, perhaps you are able to have a better picture on whether you should enroll in a Co-Op program. If you would like to have a deeper discussion about Co-Op, you can contact our current CSS Career Advisor, Borhan Saflo (email: saflob@uwindsor.ca), or our Work Integrated Learning Coordinator for STEM, Kyle Cacilhas (email: cacilhak@uwindsor.ca). Extra Readings: If you are interested in the Co-Op program, here are more resources from the Co-Op office that you can read into: 1. https://www.uwindsor.ca/coop-workplace-partnerships/ 2. https://www.uwindsor.ca/cces/1218/co-op-programs 3. https://www.uwindsor.ca/cces/ You can also look at your academic calendars for information and requirement for Co-Op programs specific to your department. For the Spring 2023 academic calendar, the Co-Op regulations for Computer Science students is on page 578: https://www.uwindsor.ca/secretariat/sites/uwindsor.ca.secretariat/files/undergraduate_calendar_spring_2023.pdf\n\nAll Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the University. The process of securing a Co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek Co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process facilitated by the Centre for Career Education. Academic Regulations Computer Science Co-op students must maintain full-time academic status and satisfy the following: (a) Must maintain a minimum average of 60%, and (b) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65%, (c) Must not have more than one grade below 50% on their transcript, and; (d) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65% during the one semester probation period. General Information Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for placement. In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed their work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the Co-op program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that work term.

It covers a bit of everything, from resumes to applying and nailing your interview. For co-op, job listings are located on the central co-op portal (link: https://success.uwindsor.ca/home.htm). For internships, you have to find listings on your own. Some good places to search: LinkedIn Jobs. LinkedIn isn't just a social platform for bugging recruiters!

Once you've gotten your first co-op/internship it's significantly easier to get the next one on your own, and many people outgrow the co-op program. Q: Can I apply for internships while in the co-op program? Answer: Co-op advisors advise against applying without their permission, but in the end there's nothing stopping you from applying for internships on your own. If you find one by yourself and want to stay in the co-op program, co-op will gladly accept that company as a co-op placement after a little screening. Q: Do grades matter? Answer: For most co-op applications you must submit your transcript. Smaller/local companies may look at grades. However, for internships, you will not need to submit your transcript for 99% of applications.\n\n    Answer the student's query: Where can I find job posting for internships?\n"

Although it is an excellent opportunity for you to develop practical skills, you should consider the pros and cons of Co-Op and whether it is worthwhile for you. Here are some benefits you get from participating in the Co-Op program: 1. Work experience: you can get workplace experience while you're still in school. This will not only boost your resume, but also give you an idea what your career can look like after graduation. 2. Money: although wages vary from student to student, you will be paid for the work that you do during the work terms. 3. Network: you get to interact with other Co-Op students and professionals in your industry. This is an opportunity for you to develop your professional network and to learn about the career paths that you were not aware of. 4. Skills: from your employment, you will be able to develop technical and soft skills outside of the classroom environment. Co-Op is also a chance for you to find the in-demand skills in your career field. 4. Time management: during the Fall term of your second year, you will need to enroll in an extra class for Co-Op training (Transform module). You will also need to apply to job positions and interview for them during your study semesters prior to your work semesters. This is a way for you to practice managing your career and academic workload. When you are applying for post-graduation jobs during your last year, this skill will come handy to you. However, you should also consider some of the drawbacks of Co-Op: 1. Less time flexibility: you are required to enroll in full time studies (4 or more classes) in the semesters before and after a work term. If you want to change your sequence from the standard Co-Op sequence, you must make a schedule for the classes you will take for the rest of your program and get it approved by the Co-Op office. 2. Less academic flexibility: to maintain your position in Co-Op, you must maintain a cumulative average of 60%, major average of 65% and no more than one outstanding grade below 50%. 3. More fees: you must pay extra semesters of Co-Op fees during your enrollment (see the note below for more detail). Even when you withdraw from the program, you must continue to pay this fee for two more semesters. 4. You are graded: during your work semesters, you are expected to write reports, assessments, learning objectives and portfolios. These activities, along with your employer's evaluation of you, will be used to determine if you passed/failed this work term. NOTE: The total cost of your Co-Op fees is dependent on the number and length of your work terms. Standardly, domestic students pay $460 for 8 semesters ($3680 in total), and international students pay $570 for 8 semesters ($4560 in total). However, if your placement is 8 months long instead of 4 months, you will make 5 payments instead and thus pay less in total. Note that this amount is for 2023-2024 and may change for future semesters. After reading some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of Co-Op, perhaps you are able to have a better picture on whether you should enroll in a Co-Op program. If you would like to have a deeper discussion about Co-Op, you can contact our current CSS Career Advisor, Borhan Saflo (email: saflob@uwindsor.ca), or our Work Integrated Learning Coordinator for STEM, Kyle Cacilhas (email: cacilhak@uwindsor.ca).

General Information Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for placement. In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed their work term requirements.

Answer: The co-op program does not start until the summer of your 2nd year; however, you can apply to internships on your own in 1st year. You should try to apply to places in 1st year, you have nothing to lose! Q: What is the difference between a co-op and internship? Answer: Co-op and internship jobs are usually very similar. They're both short-term jobs. Co-ops are usually landed through the co-op program, whereas for internships you apply to them like a normal job (i.e. find postings online and apply). See the Co-Op Versus Internship section for more details. Q: Should I pay for co-op or just go for internships? Answer: Do both! Apply for internships and use co-op as a fallback. Once you've gotten your first co-op/internship it's significantly easier to get the next one on your own, and many people outgrow the co-op program. Q: Can I apply for internships while in the co-op program? Answer: Co-op advisors advise against applying without their permission, but in the end there's nothing stopping you from applying for internships on your own. If you find one by yourself and want to stay in the co-op program, co-op will gladly accept that company as a co-op placement after a little screening. Q: Do grades matter?

Sequence of Work and Study Terms Year of Study Fall Semester Winter Semester Summer Semester Year 1 Study Study Off Year 2 Study Study Work Year 3 Study Work Study Year 4 Work Study Work Year 5 Study \n\nLast updated on 2023/10/15: The University of Windsor provides Co-Op options for both undergraduate honours and graduate computer science programs. Although it is an excellent opportunity for you to develop practical skills, you should consider the pros and cons of Co-Op and whether it is worthwhile for you. Here are some benefits you get from participating in the Co-Op program: 1. Work experience: you can get workplace experience while you're still in school. This will not only boost your resume, but also give you an idea what your career can look like after graduation. 2. Money: although wages vary from student to student, you will be paid for the work that you do during the work terms. 3. Network: you get to interact with other Co-Op students and professionals in your industry. This is an opportunity for you to develop your professional network and to learn about the career paths that you were not aware of. 4. Skills: from your employment, you will be able to develop technical and soft skills outside of the classroom environment. Co-Op is also a chance for you to find the in-demand skills in your career field. 4. Time management: during the Fall term of your second year, you will need to enroll in an extra class for Co-Op training (Transform module). You will also need to apply to job positions and interview for them during your study semesters prior to your work semesters. This is a way for you to practice managing your career and academic workload. When you are applying for post-graduation jobs during your last year, this skill will come handy to you. However, you should also consider some of the drawbacks of Co-Op: 1. Less time flexibility: you are required to enroll in full time studies (4 or more classes) in the semesters before and after a work term. If you want to change your sequence from the standard Co-Op sequence, you must make a schedule for the classes you will take for the rest of your program and get it approved by the Co-Op office. 2. Less academic flexibility: to maintain your position in Co-Op, you must maintain a cumulative average of 60%, major average of 65% and no more than one outstanding grade below 50%. 3. More fees: you must pay extra semesters of Co-Op fees during your enrollment (see the note below for more detail). Even when you withdraw from the program, you must continue to pay this fee for two more semesters. 4. You are graded: during your work semesters, you are expected to write reports, assessments, learning objectives and portfolios. These activities, along with your employer's evaluation of you, will be used to determine if you passed/failed this work term. NOTE: The total cost of your Co-Op fees is dependent on the number and length of your work terms. Standardly, domestic students pay $460 for 8 semesters ($3680 in total), and international students pay $570 for 8 semesters ($4560 in total). However, if your placement is 8 months long instead of 4 months, you will make 5 payments instead and thus pay less in total. Note that this amount is for 2023-2024 and may change for future semesters. After reading some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of Co-Op, perhaps you are able to have a better picture on whether you should enroll in a Co-Op program. If you would like to have a deeper discussion about Co-Op, you can contact our current CSS Career Advisor, Borhan Saflo (email: saflob@uwindsor.ca), or our Work Integrated Learning Coordinator for STEM, Kyle Cacilhas (email: cacilhak@uwindsor.ca).

Most of them will ask you highly technical coding questions. Interview Prep Resources: LeetCode - Eric highly recommends LeetCode and has used it for all of his interview prep. It has hundreds of questions with difficulty ratings and company-specific questions submitted by interviewees. Most internships will ask LeetCode easy or medium questions. LeetFree - This website contains all LeetCode Premium problems for free. Cracking the Coding Interview - Eric highly recommends reading this book before getting into LeetCode for interview prep. You can find it on Amazon or as a PDF online. Cracking the Coding Interview Solutions - Online solutions for the problems in Cracking the Coding Interview. Harshdip recommends to try all the problems on your own and only looking for solutions once you have tried everything you know. HackerRank - Brandon highly recommends getting familiar with the HackerRank editor and available languages. Many companies will supply a timed HackerRank coding challenge to be completed when applying to internships. It can also be used like LeetCode to solve hundreds of technical programming problems.

This is a way for you to practice managing your career and academic workload. When you are applying for post-graduation jobs during your last year, this skill will come handy to you. However, you should also consider some of the drawbacks of Co-Op: 1. Less time flexibility: you are required to enroll in full time studies (4 or more classes) in the semesters before and after a work term. If you want to change your sequence from the standard Co-Op sequence, you must make a schedule for the classes you will take for the rest of your program and get it approved by the Co-Op office. 2. Less academic flexibility: to maintain your position in Co-Op, you must maintain a cumulative average of 60%, major average of 65% and no more than one outstanding grade below 50%. 3. More fees: you must pay extra semesters of Co-Op fees during your enrollment (see the note below for more detail). Even when you withdraw from the program, you must continue to pay this fee for two more semesters. 4. You are graded: during your work semesters, you are expected to write reports, assessments, learning objectives and portfolios. These activities, along with your employer's evaluation of you, will be used to determine if you passed/failed this work term. NOTE: The total cost of your Co-Op fees is dependent on the number and length of your work terms. Standardly, domestic students pay $460 for 8 semesters ($3680 in total), and international students pay $570 for 8 semesters ($4560 in total). However, if your placement is 8 months long instead of 4 months, you will make 5 payments instead and thus pay less in total. Note that this amount is for 2023-2024 and may change for future semesters. After reading some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of Co-Op, perhaps you are able to have a better picture on whether you should enroll in a Co-Op program. If you would like to have a deeper discussion about Co-Op, you can contact our current CSS Career Advisor, Borhan Saflo (email: saflob@uwindsor.ca), or our Work Integrated Learning Coordinator for STEM, Kyle Cacilhas (email: cacilhak@uwindsor.ca). Extra Readings: If you are interested in the Co-Op program, here are more resources from the Co-Op office that you can read into: 1. https://www.uwindsor.ca/coop-workplace-partnerships/ 2. https://www.uwindsor.ca/cces/1218/co-op-programs 3. https://www.uwindsor.ca/cces/ You can also look at your academic calendars for information and requirement for Co-Op programs specific to your department. For the Spring 2023 academic calendar, the Co-Op regulations for Computer Science students is on page 578: https://www.uwindsor.ca/secretariat/sites/uwindsor.ca.secretariat/files/undergraduate_calendar_spring_2023.pdf\n\nAll Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the University. The process of securing a Co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek Co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process facilitated by the Centre for Career Education. Academic Regulations Computer Science Co-op students must maintain full-time academic status and satisfy the following: (a) Must maintain a minimum average of 60%, and (b) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65%, (c) Must not have more than one grade below 50% on their transcript, and; (d) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65% during the one semester probation period. General Information Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for placement. In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed their work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the Co-op program and will result in a failing grade on his/her transcript for that work term.

It covers a bit of everything, from resumes to applying and nailing your interview. For co-op, job listings are located on the central co-op portal (link: https://success.uwindsor.ca/home.htm). For internships, you have to find listings on your own. Some good places to search: LinkedIn Jobs. LinkedIn isn't just a social platform for bugging recruiters! It has an integrated job board with tons of internships. Intern Supply, though the links are usually broken. It can serve as a master list of fantastic companies that offer internships. Work In Tech has an extensive list of job opportunities, though most of them are not internships. Pitt-CSC (link: https://github.com/pittcsc) has a giant open source repo that tracks open CS internships for a lot of companies. The organization had a repo for new grad roles, but it is no longer maintained. A current version is maintained by coderQuad (link: https://github.com/coderQuad/New-Grad-Positions-2023). WARNING: Co-op has been known to decline winter internship offers for second-year students because they haven't completed their co-op course training.

The CSCareersQuestions subreddit is a good resource. Also see the job hunting and resume sections. \\n Pay-Usually around $18-30/hour in Canada-Varies significantly but tends to pay more than co-op. \\n Cost-Undergrad Domestic Students: $455.0 x 8 terms - Undergrad International Students: $565.00 x 8 terms-None. \\n Companies-Many job postings are available on mySuccess; some are exclusive to Co-op students.

For Canada, Toronto, Waterloo, and Vancouver are the biggest tech hubs. For the US, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and New York are the biggest. \\n  Listings/Application-Co-op portal lists all companies. Applications usually done within the portal-On your own to find/apply to companies.\n\nWorking in the US: Almost every major tech company in the US hires Canadians and will sponsor you for a visa (usually an application will specify if they won't sponsor a visa). US companies tend to pay significantly more and offer great opportunities. Visa: You'll need a visa to intern/work full-time in the US. A common misconception is that you can get a visa yourself - this is not true. You need a company who is willing to sponsor your visa to work in the United States. Once you find this company they will do most of the work for you, you'll just have to submit some documents/forms. Don't stress about this step.

Getting Paid: You'll need an American bank account or a cross-border banking account (e.g. TD Cross-Border Banking) to get paid if you're working in the US. This is very easy to obtain - just go to your preferred bank once you're in the US and bring your passport, job offer letter, and visa documents just in case. They may ask for a US address to open an American bank account. Some companies will require you to obtain a Social Security Number in the US. It's also a very good idea regardless so that you can apply for a credit card and build up a credit score in the US (can be helpful in many ways in the future). This is also straight-forward, but you need to wait until you're in the US for at least 10 days before you can apply and you might also need to wait for your employment to start.

Sincerely, (Handwritten Signature) First Last.\n\nLast updated on 2023/09/24: Why Cover Letter? While your resume will highlight and summarize your most relevant skills and experience, your cover letter will emphasize your most important qualifications and your personality. An effective cover letter should convince the recruiter that you possess relevant skills and the right attitude that adds value to the company. It's also a chance to show your excitement and interest in the company before the interview. Content of your Cover Letter Header Your header should look the same as the header on your resume as mentioned above. It's more professional and consistent when you look at your entire application. Date The date of the cover letter should match the day you submitted your job application. Employer's Info You must include the employer's name, their job title, the name of the company, and the address of the workplace. You might need to do some research regarding the employer and the company because the required information may not be in the job posting. If you can't find some of the information even after researching, then it's okay to just include the name of the company. But include as much information as you find. Salutation The formal way to start a salutation is with 'Dear'. If you know the full name of your employer, then use the employer's first and last name in your salutation. If the name of the employer is not given, then you can refer to them as 'Hiring Manager' or 'Recruiter'. Introduction This section of your cover letter is the most important. Your introductory paragraph will determine whether the reader will read the rest of your cover letter or not. Thus, it's very important to grab your employer's attention in this paragraph. Here are some ways you can grab your employer's attention: Discuss your passion for working with the company and why you're excited Briefly highlight your most relevant skills and experiences Demonstrate your knowledge of the company by mentioning their products and services When expressing your interest in the position you're applying for, you must talk about how the company will benefit when they select you rather than what you can gain from the job. Employers will always prioritize the success of the company and will select applicants based on that. Middle This paragraph (or two) will go into detail regarding the relevant skills and experience you mentioned in your introductory paragraph or on your resume. This is where you prove you are the perfect candidate for the job. You do this by demonstrating you understand the role and what will be required from you in the workplace. Do not try to go over everything on your resume. Discuss one or two relevant experiences (work, volunteering, projects, etc) that relate to the requirements and skills the employer is asking for. Conclusion This final paragraph should summarize your relevant skills and interests. You should thank the employer for taking the time to review your application and express your interest in an interview. You should end off with 'Sincerely' or 'Regards' followed by your first and last name. Don't forget to include your signature.\n\nHeader: Include your name, contact information, GitHub, Linkedin and your personal website (if you have one) Your name must be the largest font Education Put down the University you're studying at and the name of your program Include relevant coursework Only include your GPA if it's above a 90 Skills Refer to the job description and add essential keywords on your resume to increase your chance of getting an interview DO NOT simply list all the keywords on the job description for the sake of showing you\u2019re a good fit.

I was excited to learn about the CME Group Summer Data Science Intern position as advertised on Handshake, and I would value the opportunity to work for a company that uses technology to impact global markets. I believe my fluency in Java and Python, along with my background in data analytics make me a strong candidate for this position. As the Open Source Website Development Intern at Loyola, I have spent this past academic year creating a website, from inception to production deployment, using JavaScript and HTML to track the prices of products on Amazon.com over time. I also wrote RSpec tests to ensure that site functionality was maintained during development and to prevent the inclusion of regression bugs. In addition, as a Research Assistant to Dr. Kalchthaler in the Loyola School of Education, I researched the use of computer software in Chicago Public Schools and analyzed data using SPSS-X software. Using Java and Python, I programmed a specialized database to track findings, and I presented research results to Dr. Kalchthaler and two PhD-level interns at weekly meetings. Through my computer science coursework at Loyola, I have gained additional programming skills in languages such as SQL and C/C++, as well as applied knowledge of operating systems such as Linux. My passion for financial markets has led me to minor in finance, through which I\u2019ve learned about commodity and derivative markets, and become increasingly interested in global economics.

Sincerely, (Handwritten Signature) First Last.\n\nLast updated on 2023/09/24: Why Cover Letter? While your resume will highlight and summarize your most relevant skills and experience, your cover letter will emphasize your most important qualifications and your personality. An effective cover letter should convince the recruiter that you possess relevant skills and the right attitude that adds value to the company. It's also a chance to show your excitement and interest in the company before the interview. Content of your Cover Letter Header Your header should look the same as the header on your resume as mentioned above. It's more professional and consistent when you look at your entire application. Date The date of the cover letter should match the day you submitted your job application. Employer's Info You must include the employer's name, their job title, the name of the company, and the address of the workplace. You might need to do some research regarding the employer and the company because the required information may not be in the job posting. If you can't find some of the information even after researching, then it's okay to just include the name of the company. But include as much information as you find. Salutation The formal way to start a salutation is with 'Dear'. If you know the full name of your employer, then use the employer's first and last name in your salutation. If the name of the employer is not given, then you can refer to them as 'Hiring Manager' or 'Recruiter'. Introduction This section of your cover letter is the most important. Your introductory paragraph will determine whether the reader will read the rest of your cover letter or not. Thus, it's very important to grab your employer's attention in this paragraph. Here are some ways you can grab your employer's attention: Discuss your passion for working with the company and why you're excited Briefly highlight your most relevant skills and experiences Demonstrate your knowledge of the company by mentioning their products and services When expressing your interest in the position you're applying for, you must talk about how the company will benefit when they select you rather than what you can gain from the job. Employers will always prioritize the success of the company and will select applicants based on that. Middle This paragraph (or two) will go into detail regarding the relevant skills and experience you mentioned in your introductory paragraph or on your resume. This is where you prove you are the perfect candidate for the job. You do this by demonstrating you understand the role and what will be required from you in the workplace. Do not try to go over everything on your resume. Discuss one or two relevant experiences (work, volunteering, projects, etc) that relate to the requirements and skills the employer is asking for. Conclusion This final paragraph should summarize your relevant skills and interests. You should thank the employer for taking the time to review your application and express your interest in an interview. You should end off with 'Sincerely' or 'Regards' followed by your first and last name. Don't forget to include your signature.\n\nHeader: Include your name, contact information, GitHub, Linkedin and your personal website (if you have one) Your name must be the largest font Education Put down the University you're studying at and the name of your program Include relevant coursework Only include your GPA if it's above a 90 Skills Refer to the job description and add essential keywords on your resume to increase your chance of getting an interview DO NOT simply list all the keywords on the job description for the sake of showing you\u2019re a good fit.

Getting 1st or 2nd place at a hackathon. 4. President, vice-president or a head of a club.\n\nCreating a Resume: Recruiters spend, on average, between 6 and 10 seconds looking at your resume. Its important that your resume makes a strong first impression and demonstrates why you're a strong candidate for the position. Your resume should be at most one page, cover your past experience, technical skills, projects, relevant education, and soft skills. Do not include your secondary school education - if you've made it to University, you probably did well in secondary school. Passing the ATS Scanner: It's no surprise that resume checkers have become automated especially for larger companies who get thousands of applicants. Companies now use ATS (applicant tracking system) to parse your resumes before it reaches an actual human being. Knowing how to pass the ATS scanner is important in getting an interview. So, how do they work? ATS software uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to score and sort resumes based on how well they align with job requirements. An ATS will scan your resume for keywords and relevant work history to make a decision on whether you will advance to the next round, optimizing your resume so that it passes the ATS scan is an important step in your job search. Otherwise, your resume can be rejected despite your qualifications for the job. A few simple strategies can help set your resume up for success in passing through an applicant tracking system. Keep Things Simple An aesthetically pleasing resume with headers, different fonts, and visuals won\u2019t do much to impress an ATS. Also, use a resume template. Resume templates have a higher chance of being parsed properly by an ATS compared to a resume made from scratch. Also, the content of your resume should be aligned to the left. It makes your resume more readable this way. \u201cMost ATS strip out formatting and parse the plain text, but you can still make your resume look nice. It is best to stay away from inserting graphics, columns, headers, footers, or tables. ATS reads top to bottom and left to right, if you have columns built into separate information the ATS might read two separate categories of information as one. Standard headers for categories, bold, capital letters, italics are all ok. Most ATS can read a PDF but Word document is almost always the safest bet.\u201d says Carolyn Kleiman, career coach and expert at ResumeBuilder.com I recommend using templates from Overleaf since they're designed to be properly parsed by ATS. Even so, stick with simple looking templates without anything fancy. Don't Forget to Include Keywords Another tip is to carefully tailor your resume to the job description. If there are skills listed in the job description that you have, make sure to add them before you submit it. ATS scans for keywords that were listed in the job description. This also helps once your resume reaches a recruiter. Recruiters aren't people with programming knowledge. They'll be asked to look for the listed keywords from the posting.\n\nHere is a sample cover letter that you can use as a blueprint for your future cover letters: Date Company Name Workplace Address City State/Province Postal Code Dear Hiring Manager, I am in [Year of Study] at [University Name] majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Finance.

            "content": "\n    Consider the following context containing information about the Computer Science program at The University of Windsor: Creating a Resume: Recruiters spend, on average, between 6 and 10 seconds looking at your resume. Its important that your resume makes a strong first impression and demonstrates why you're a strong candidate for the position. Your resume should be at most one page, cover your past experience, technical skills, projects, relevant education, and soft skills. Do not include your secondary school education - if you've made it to University, you probably did well in secondary school. Passing the ATS Scanner: It's no surprise that resume checkers have become automated especially for larger companies who get thousands of applicants. Companies now use ATS (applicant tracking system) to parse your resumes before it reaches an actual human being. Knowing how to pass the ATS scanner is important in getting an interview. So, how do they work? ATS software uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to score and sort resumes based on how well they align with job requirements. An ATS will scan your resume for keywords and relevant work history to make a decision on whether you will advance to the next round, optimizing your resume so that it passes the ATS scan is an important step in your job search. Otherwise, your resume can be rejected despite your qualifications for the job. A few simple strategies can help set your resume up for success in passing through an applicant tracking system. Keep Things Simple An aesthetically pleasing resume with headers, different fonts, and visuals won\u2019t do much to impress an ATS. Also, use a resume template. Resume templates have a higher chance of being parsed properly by an ATS compared to a resume made from scratch. Also, the content of your resume should be aligned to the left. It makes your resume more readable this way. \u201cMost ATS strip out formatting and parse the plain text, but you can still make your resume look nice. It is best to stay away from inserting graphics, columns, headers, footers, or tables. ATS reads top to bottom and left to right, if you have columns built into separate information the ATS might read two separate categories of information as one. Standard headers for categories, bold, capital letters, italics are all ok. Most ATS can read a PDF but Word document is almost always the safest bet.\u201d says Carolyn Kleiman, career coach and expert at ResumeBuilder.com I recommend using templates from Overleaf since they're designed to be properly parsed by ATS. Even so, stick with simple looking templates without anything fancy. Don't Forget to Include Keywords Another tip is to carefully tailor your resume to the job description. If there are skills listed in the job description that you have, make sure to add them before you submit it. ATS scans for keywords that were listed in the job description. This also helps once your resume reaches a recruiter. Recruiters aren't people with programming knowledge. They'll be asked to look for the listed keywords from the posting.\n\nHeader: Include your name, contact information, GitHub, Linkedin and your personal website (if you have one) Your name must be the largest font Education Put down the University you're studying at and the name of your program Include relevant coursework Only include your GPA if it's above a 90 Skills Refer to the job description and add essential keywords on your resume to increase your chance of getting an interview DO NOT simply list all the keywords on the job description for the sake of showing you\u2019re a good fit. You WILL be questioned on the skills you've listed in the interview Projects The most important section if you don't have experience Projects can showcase your passion for programming and your knowledge on languages and tools a company utilizes. \u201cBuild some iPhone apps, web apps, whatever! Honestly it doesn\u2019t matter that much what you\u2019re building as long as you\u2019re building something. You can build a fairly meaty project in one weekend. This means that with about 3\u20134 weekends of work, you can make your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 go from so-so to fantastic. Seriously \u2014 I\u2019ve seen lots of people do this.\u201d - Gayle McDowell, former Google Engineer and Author of Cracking the Coding Interview. Experience Focus only on including work experience that has relevance to the job that you are applying for Keep your points brief and to the point Have various versions of your resume tailored for each job you are applying for. There is no one-size-fits-all resume. The most important thing is to describe what you've accomplished, not just what task you were assigned. Use the \u201cAccomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]\u201d formula. It\u2019s the most effective way of showing recruiters your impact. In general, numbers and metrics are a great way to show off the positive impact you had at your workplace.

Others Other sections include extracurriculars, awards, certificates, volunteering, etc. Include them if they relate to the job you're applying to or if it's something exceptional. Things to include can relate the following: 1. Computer science related volunteering experience. 2. Certificates that relate to the skills the job is asking for. 3. Getting 1st or 2nd place at a hackathon. 4. President, vice-president or a head of a club.\n\nLast updated on 2023/09/24: Why Cover Letter? While your resume will highlight and summarize your most relevant skills and experience, your cover letter will emphasize your most important qualifications and your personality. An effective cover letter should convince the recruiter that you possess relevant skills and the right attitude that adds value to the company. It's also a chance to show your excitement and interest in the company before the interview. Content of your Cover Letter Header Your header should look the same as the header on your resume as mentioned above. It's more professional and consistent when you look at your entire application. Date The date of the cover letter should match the day you submitted your job application. Employer's Info You must include the employer's name, their job title, the name of the company, and the address of the workplace. You might need to do some research regarding the employer and the company because the required information may not be in the job posting. If you can't find some of the information even after researching, then it's okay to just include the name of the company. But include as much information as you find. Salutation The formal way to start a salutation is with 'Dear'. If you know the full name of your employer, then use the employer's first and last name in your salutation. If the name of the employer is not given, then you can refer to them as 'Hiring Manager' or 'Recruiter'. Introduction This section of your cover letter is the most important. Your introductory paragraph will determine whether the reader will read the rest of your cover letter or not. Thus, it's very important to grab your employer's attention in this paragraph. Here are some ways you can grab your employer's attention: Discuss your passion for working with the company and why you're excited Briefly highlight your most relevant skills and experiences Demonstrate your knowledge of the company by mentioning their products and services When expressing your interest in the position you're applying for, you must talk about how the company will benefit when they select you rather than what you can gain from the job. Employers will always prioritize the success of the company and will select applicants based on that. Middle This paragraph (or two) will go into detail regarding the relevant skills and experience you mentioned in your introductory paragraph or on your resume. This is where you prove you are the perfect candidate for the job. You do this by demonstrating you understand the role and what will be required from you in the workplace. Do not try to go over everything on your resume. Discuss one or two relevant experiences (work, volunteering, projects, etc) that relate to the requirements and skills the employer is asking for. Conclusion This final paragraph should summarize your relevant skills and interests. You should thank the employer for taking the time to review your application and express your interest in an interview. You should end off with 'Sincerely' or 'Regards' followed by your first and last name. Don't forget to include your signature.\n\n    Answer the student's query: How should I format a resume\n"

You WILL be questioned on the skills you've listed in the interview Projects The most important section if you don't have experience Projects can showcase your passion for programming and your knowledge on languages and tools a company utilizes. \u201cBuild some iPhone apps, web apps, whatever! Honestly it doesn\u2019t matter that much what you\u2019re building as long as you\u2019re building something. You can build a fairly meaty project in one weekend. This means that with about 3\u20134 weekends of work, you can make your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 go from so-so to fantastic. Seriously \u2014 I\u2019ve seen lots of people do this.\u201d - Gayle McDowell, former Google Engineer and Author of Cracking the Coding Interview. Experience Focus only on including work experience that has relevance to the job that you are applying for Keep your points brief and to the point Have various versions of your resume tailored for each job you are applying for. There is no one-size-fits-all resume. The most important thing is to describe what you've accomplished, not just what task you were assigned. Use the \u201cAccomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]\u201d formula. It\u2019s the most effective way of showing recruiters your impact. In general, numbers and metrics are a great way to show off the positive impact you had at your workplace. List of Action Words to Use on your Resume (link: https://www.colorado.edu/career/job-searching/resumes-and-cover-letters/resumes/action-verbs-use-your-resume) - When you have no clue how to word your accomplishments, use this website for ideas :). Others Other sections include extracurriculars, awards, certificates, volunteering, etc. Include them if they relate to the job you're applying to or if it's something exceptional. Things to include can relate the following: 1. Computer science related volunteering experience. 2. Certificates that relate to the skills the job is asking for. 3. Getting 1st or 2nd place at a hackathon. 4. President, vice-president or a head of a club.\n\nSee Eric's presentation (link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SmtxP4vNIoEEulzTKZvc8nDBA1utS7O0fIA_d3h0gOU/edit?usp=sharing) on behalf of CSS for landing internships.

For the US, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and New York are the biggest. \\n  Listings/Application-Co-op portal lists all companies. Applications usually done within the portal-On your own to find/apply to companies.\n\nSee Eric's presentation (link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SmtxP4vNIoEEulzTKZvc8nDBA1utS7O0fIA_d3h0gOU/edit?usp=sharing) on behalf of CSS for landing internships. It covers a bit of everything, from resumes to applying and nailing your interview. For co-op, job listings are located on the central co-op portal (link: https://success.uwindsor.ca/home.htm). For internships, you have to find listings on your own. Some good places to search: LinkedIn Jobs. LinkedIn isn't just a social platform for bugging recruiters! It has an integrated job board with tons of internships. Intern Supply, though the links are usually broken. It can serve as a master list of fantastic companies that offer internships. Work In Tech has an extensive list of job opportunities, though most of them are not internships. Pitt-CSC (link: https://github.com/pittcsc) has a giant open source repo that tracks open CS internships for a lot of companies. The organization had a repo for new grad roles, but it is no longer maintained. A current version is maintained by coderQuad (link: https://github.com/coderQuad/New-Grad-Positions-2023). WARNING: Co-op has been known to decline winter internship offers for second-year students because they haven't completed their co-op course training. If you wish to have a winter internship before you have done your co-op course training, make sure it is one that doesn't go through co-op.\n\n    Answer the student's query: How do I get an internship in the USA\n"

            "content": "To get an internship in the USA, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Search for Opportunities**: Start looking for internship listings on various platforms. Some recommended sites include LinkedIn Jobs, Intern Supply, Work In Tech, and the Pitt-CSC GitHub repository for open CS internships.\n\n2. **Prepare Your Application**: Enhance your resume and prepare for interviews by seeking assistance through workshops. Resources like Eric's presentation on landing internships can be beneficial.\n\n3. **Visa Requirements**: If you secure an internship in the USA, you will need a visa to work there. The common visa for internships is the J-1 Visa. This process typically requires a company that is willing to sponsor your visa. Make sure to check if the internship you're applying for specifies whether they sponsor visas.\n\n4. **Banking and Social Security**: Once you secure an internship, you'll need to set up an American bank account or a cross-border banking account to receive payments. Additionally, obtaining a Social Security Number (SSN) can be beneficial for various purposes, including applying for a credit card. You can apply for an SSN once you are in the USA.\n\n5. **Networking**: Use platforms like LinkedIn not only to search for internships but also to connect with professionals in your field. Networking can often lead to job opportunities.\n\n6. **Know the Market**: Understand the job market and typical pay rates for internships in the US, as they tend to pay more than co-op positions in Canada.\n\nMake sure to keep an eye on application deadlines and any specific requirements from the companies you are targeting. Good luck with your search!"

Once the form is submitted, if a successful candidate you will hear back from the University with an offer letter typically 14 weeks before classes begin. One important thing to note is the University has the right to change your position if needed. This means if you are offered to TA for one course and sign the contract, they could simply send you an email saying you have been reassigned to another course instead. To accept a TA position there are a few steps involved: 1. Reply to the email offer with a message accepting the offer   E.g. 'I accept this offer and confirm that I will be available to report for inperson duties in F/W/S term 20XX.' 2. Confirm you are enrolled in at least one course  3. Digitally sign the contract 3 4. Complete the HR hiring package   This will include signing multiple forms for the University's records like an offer letter, duties check list, Ontario Taxes form , Canadian Taxes form (TD1), and possibly more   Some forms will ask for an employee number, if this is your first time working for the University leave this blank and they will provide you with one on a later date. If you have an employee number but do not remember it, look at your employee profile on the University of Windsor Employee Site 4 5. Ping a Mod in the CSS Discord to give you the TA Role    This role will help students recognize you as a TA, giving you another space to help students   It could also assist you as a way to contact other TAs in case you have a further question about the process, or responsibilities involved Once you submit all of your paper work you must wait for confirmation from HR before beginning any work as a TA. You can communicate and meet with the instructor, however not begin any work until this confirmation is received.   TA Resources Once accepting a TA position there are (https://ctl2.uwindsor.ca/workshops/) 5 that are offered by the University that you can take to help you during your term. Some training courses are required, others optional. Most are one time only, meaning the next time you are a TA, you will not be required to do them again.

It will give you helpful insight into how research study works, and you will build a good relationship with different faculty members who will help you when you apply for grad school. Conversely, research is a great way to let you know whether if you want to pursue graduate studies. Doing research requires a lot of independent reading and studying on the subject of your research. You will need to work with data and models. In addition, you will need to apply your knowledge and critically analyze your research to investigate a question that does not have any 'right' answer. If you feel like that you enjoy doing these things, then research may be the right path for you. It is okay to not be completely sure if you want to do research or not: going to University is the chance to explore your interests and passions. If you feel that you like the idea of continuing graduate studies or if you feel like you'd be interested in research work, then you absolutely should look for research opportunities. However, if those ideas don't appeal to you, then Co-op/Internship may be a better path. You will gain different practical skills and experience that will help you. Ways To Get Involved With Research The University has a program called Outstanding Scholars where students from all faculties can get involved in research projects. Sometimes, professors will also post research opportunities on Ignite (MySuccess) or in your student community. As well, many professors will showcase their research during fairs, Meet the Prof Nights, and other events. You can always talk to professors whose research interests you: they may be looking for more volunteers/research assistants.\n\n    Answer the student's query: How can I be a Teaching Assistant??\n"

Enrolling in Courses  Which Courses to Take :::important These wiki resources are maintained by student contributors. Always verify important academic information with a primary university resource or an academic advisor. ::: There are several computer science programs offered by the University of Windsor, each with their own course requirements which can be found in the undergraduate calendar. If you follow the recommended course sequence, many programs will share the same courses for the first term. They are COMP1000, COMP1400, MATH1250 (or MATH1260), MATH1720 (or MATH1760), and an elective. See the Courses section for a userfriendly table of course requirements by program.  How to Enroll Incoming first year students typically have the earliest appointment time and may enroll in courses before all other students. Your appointment time can be found on UWinsite under My Academics > Enrollment Deadlines. It is recommended to enroll as early as possible, as courses have a limited capacity and desireable timeslots fill up quickly. See the UWinsite Guide for more details on how to enroll in classes.  Recommended Software for Computer Science As a computer science student, you will learn to program in a variety of programming languages, starting with the C Programming Language in COMP1400. Installing and familiarizing yourself with the necessary software on your personal computer before the first day of classes will save you time and stress, especially if you are new to programming. All of the following software can be downloaded for free.  Code Editor: Visual Studio Code  Description A code editor helps a programmer write code (like Microsoft Word but for programming). Code can be written in any text editor, but a good code editor will provide features like syntax highlighting, basic error checking, and autocompletion for several programming languages. Note that a code editor is not an IDE (integrated development environment). For example, Visual Studio is an IDE while Visual Studio Code is a code editor and a seperate piece of software. An IDE will typically provide builtin tools to run, debug, and examine your code for a specific language, while a code editor will not (or will require you to install additional tools to do so).\n\nBachelor of Computer Science (Honours) This program is available with or without Co-op).

            "content": "\n    Consider the following context containing information about the Computer Science program at The University of Windsor: Although Linux OS may be confusing for new users, becoming comfortable with a UNIX/Linux environment is very beneficial for you. The University generally expects you to produce code/projects that will work on its Linux server. As well, Linux forces you to interact with the command line more, which is great if you want to learn more about how your computer works underneath. Almost all Linux distros are free, especially the popular ones. In general, Linux distros require less disk space and perform better on lowend devices, compared to Windows. Thus, the right Linux distro will significantly optimize your laptop, especially if you are on a budget. However, Linux is also generally worse for battery life compared to other OS.  MacOS Since the MacOS is a UNIX operating system, it is usually easier to set up local programming environment than Windows. As well, it is also among the most supported OS in terms of IT support and app availability. However, MacOS is generally not compatible with nonApple products. This means that you would need to purchase a MacBook to use MacOS, which may be expensive/less costeffective depending on your budget and what specifications you're looking for. Much like Linux OS, it can be difficult to game on. Depending on how important gaming is to you, you may need to use Wine, set up a virtual machine, or dualboot with Windows.  ChromeOS (Chromebook) The ChromeOS is a Linuxbased operating system derived from the Chromium OS. However, ChromeOS is generally not compatible with nonChromebook products. Although Chromebooks are typically lightweight, portable and have good battery life, you usually cannot install much on them since they generally have low specifications. Although you can set up programming environments on them using a Linux container, having a low hardware specifications may decrease the performance. As such, Chromebooks (or other laptops like Surface Pro) are best used for doing quick works on the campus while having a more powerful desktop/laptop at home.  Battery Life and Portability Battery life and portability are probably the most important factors that you should think about when purchasing a laptop. You should purchase a laptop that has decent battery life and is reasonably light. Alternatively, you can look for ergonomicallyengineered laptop bags that can store your chargers so that you won't get hurt as you exercise around the campus. Some factors, like a laptop's hardware, may affect its weight and battery life. Powerful CPUs, for example, often drains battery quicker. Extremely small and lightweight laptops often have smaller fans and vents and thus heat up easily, which can also reduce battery life. It is therefore important to research about your laptop choices and test them in person before making a purchase.  Screen Size Common screen size range from 13' to 17', but it is recommended to keep your selection between 13'' to 15'' for portability. If you are looking for a more portable laptop, then 13'' will be a better choice. However, this also means that you will see less content on the screen at a time, especially when you make the fonts bigger for ergonomic purposes. On the other hand, a 15'' laptop can display more content but are also heavier and thus less portable.  Other Features Although features like 2in1 and touchscreen are very useful for purposes like digital art, they may not be very useful on the campus other than taking digital notes. If you are purchasing a laptop that is going to mostly be used on campus, then you can subsitute with a drawing tablet to save money.\n\nid: laptopguide title: Laptop Requirements Guide sidebarlabel: Laptop Requirements Guide slug: /guides/laptop  Last updated on 2022/08/24 Here are a few things to keep in mind when purchasing/configuring your laptop:  Hardware Although the following specifications are not strictly required, having these minimum specifications will make your computer less frustrating to use:  8 GB of RAM   for gaming/futureproof purposes, 12 or 16 GB is more preferable  256 GB of SSD storage   UWindsor provides 1 TB OneDrive cloud storage. However, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade to at least 512 GB. This will allow you to have space for a lot of games and software, and the extra local storage is good if you don't want the hassle of constantly uploading and downloading files from the cloud.  Operating System You aren't required to have certain OS since the School of Computer Science has remote Linux server that you can connect to, but here are a few pros and cons to help you decide which OS to use:  Windows Windows is one of the most popular OS among students, particularly because it comes with most preassembled laptops. The user interface should be fairly intuitive even when you are new to using laptops, and it is one of the most supported OS for app availability or IT support. Additionally, it is much easier to game on Windows. Many Computer Science classes (COMP1400 and COMP1410, for example) will require programming environments that are harder to set up in Windows than in other UNIX/Linuxbased OS. Although substitutes like WSL can help, you might run into compatibility issues when working with sockets and pipes in classes like COMP2560. Virtual machines shouldn't have compatibility issues, but they can require a lot of computing power, especially when GUI is involved. Should you choose Windows as your primary OS, you should consider setting up an SSH connection to the UWindsor's remote server on editors like Visual Studio Code or via other means. In addition, when you are working with other developers on a project, you may also have to pay attention to your line breaks (CRLF vs. LF). If you are taking classes offered by other faculties or departments (e.g. Engineering), you may have to install software that are only available on Windows. However, this usually is not a concern since such instances are quite rare, and the University of Windsor has many other computer resources to help you out if something like this happens.  Linux Linux/UNIX is very good for programming/developing because of how easy it is to set up the necessary environment. Much like MacOS, it can be difficult to game on. Depending on how important gaming is to you, you may need to use Wine, set up a virtual machine, or dualboot with Windows. Additionally, since many of the University's software (Office 365, OneDrive, Teams, etc.) are on the Microsoft platform, there may be some compatibility issues. Popular Linux distros include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Pop_OS, Linux Mint, and Arch Linux. If you are very new to Linux, then Ubuntu and Debian may be a good starting point for you simply because there is a large community using them and most likely have answers for any problem you encounter. The University, for example, uses Debian on its remote servers. If you have time and are willing to experiment, you should test out the different Linux OS since the desktop environment on Ubuntu and Debian (GNOME) can be slightly laggy on laptops without high specifications. If you are coming from Windows, Linux Mint's Cinnamon desktop environment will help you adjust to Linux as it has a look and feel comparable to that of Windows.\n\nid: firstyearguide title: First Year Guide sidebarlabel: First Year Guide slug: /guides/firstyear  last updated on 2022/09/06 This guide is intended to help incoming first year students prepare for a computer science degree at the University of Windsor. It addresses some general information about being a student at the University of Windsor and provides resources specifically to help students succeed in computer science courses.  Getting Started at the University of Windsor  UWin Accounts Every student must have a UWin Account in order to access the university's online services. Instructions to set up your UWin account will be sent to your personal email after you've been accepted into a program at the university. You will be assigned a UWin ID and will create a password during this process; these will be used as your login information. Your UWindsor email will be yourUWinI@uwindsor.ca.  Online Services Some of the online services you can access using your UWin Account include:  UWinsite Student For browsing and enrolling in classes, viewing tuition and fees, accessing acedamic information, applying for scholarships, and more. See the UWinsite Guide for more details and help.  Brightspace The university's Learning Management System (LMS). It is used to view course material, submit coursework, review grades, and more.  Microsoft Office 365 All University of Windsor students have access to a full suite of Microsoft Office 365 tools and software, including Outlook for email services and OneDrive for 1 TB of free cloud storage. A Microsoft Account is automatically created using your UWindsor Email and UWin Account Password. See this FAQ for more details.  Enrolling in Courses  Which Courses to Take :::important These wiki resources are maintained by student contributors. Always verify important academic information with a primary university resource or an academic advisor. ::: There are several computer science programs offered by the University of Windsor, each with their own course requirements which can be found in the undergraduate calendar. If you follow the recommended course sequence, many programs will share the same courses for the first term. They are COMP1000, COMP1400, MATH1250 (or MATH1260), MATH1720 (or MATH1760), and an elective. See the Courses section for a userfriendly table of course requirements by program.  How to Enroll Incoming first year students typically have the earliest appointment time and may enroll in courses before all other students. Your appointment time can be found on UWinsite under My Academics > Enrollment Deadlines. It is recommended to enroll as early as possible, as courses have a limited capacity and desireable timeslots fill up quickly. See the UWinsite Guide for more details on how to enroll in classes.  Recommended Software for Computer Science As a computer science student, you will learn to program in a variety of programming languages, starting with the C Programming Language in COMP1400. Installing and familiarizing yourself with the necessary software on your personal computer before the first day of classes will save you time and stress, especially if you are new to programming. All of the following software can be downloaded for free.  Code Editor: Visual Studio Code  Description A code editor helps a programmer write code (like Microsoft Word but for programming). Code can be written in any text editor, but a good code editor will provide features like syntax highlighting, basic error checking, and autocompletion for several programming languages. Note that a code editor is not an IDE (integrated development environment). For example, Visual Studio is an IDE while Visual Studio Code is a code editor and a seperate piece of software. An IDE will typically provide builtin tools to run, debug, and examine your code for a specific language, while a code editor will not (or will require you to install additional tools to do so).\n\n    Answer the student's query: What Laptop should I buy for my program?\n"

            "content": "When choosing a laptop for your Computer Science program at the University of Windsor, here are some recommendations to consider:\n\n1. **Hardware Specifications**:\n   - **RAM**: Aim for at least 8 GB of RAM; however, 12 or 16 GB is preferable, especially for future-proofing your device.\n   - **Storage**: Look for a laptop with at least 256 GB of SSD storage. While UWindsor provides 1 TB of OneDrive cloud storage, having additional local storage (around 512 GB or more) is beneficial for software and games.\n\n2. **Operating System**:\n   - **Linux/UNIX**: Highly recommended for programming and development. It\u2019s generally easier to set up programming environments. Popular distributions include Ubuntu or Debian, which are suitable for beginners and facilities used on campus. Keep in mind that many courses may expect you to produce code that works on the university's Linux servers.\n   - **Windows**: It's the most popular OS among students, good for gaming and has a user-friendly interface. However, some programming environments may be harder to set up compared to Linux/UNIX. If you choose Windows, consider configuring an SSH connection to access the university's remote Linux server.\n   - **MacOS**: If you prefer UNIX-based systems and you can afford a MacBook, this can be a good option. It\u2019s generally easier to set up a programming environment than Windows but may not be compatible with non-Apple products.\n\n3. **Portability & Battery Life**:\n   - Look for a laptop that has decent battery life and is lightweight. These factors are important since you'll likely be moving around campus. Common screen sizes range from 13\" to 17\", with 13\" to 15\" being recommended for portability, although a larger screen can display more content but be heavier.\n\n4. **Additional Features**:\n   - Features like touchscreen or 2-in-1 designs may not be essential for your studies, so focus on value for your budget.\n\nIn summary, a laptop with at least 8 GB of RAM, a minimum of 256 GB SSD, and the flexibility to run Linux or Windows should serve you well in your Computer Science program. Make sure to do thorough research and consider trying out devices in person before purchasing to ensure that they meet your needs."

It provides builtin support for several programming languages, including C, and hundreds more are supported through downloadable extensions. It is recommended over an IDE for two reasons: (1) its portability to other programming languages and (2) it forces students to learn how to transform code into an executable program using the command line.  Installing Windows, Mac, and Linux downloads are available on the official website. Instructions for each operating system can be found with a quick web search if needed.  Resources  First Year Bootcamp  Setting up VSCode Workshop: a workshop hosted by CSS to get VS Code up and running on Windows. Note that this workshop also provides a way to install a C compiler using MinGW, which is an alternative way to the one recommended in this guide, using WSL. MinGW is not needed for VS Code itself, and can be skipped in favour of WSL (see the next section).  Windows Subsystem for Linux (Windows Only)  Description Linux is the preferred operating system for many programmers. It is also the operating system found on the School of Computer Science's servers and computers, which you will need to use for class work and verifying code compatibility (code written on one system may behave differently on another system). For these reasons, it is recommended that students familiarize themselves with the Linux environment. Recent versions of Windows have made it easy to work in a Linux environment within Windows, rather than having to run it in a virtual machine or as a secondary operating system. This is done using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).  Installing The official WSL guide provides more details about WSL, its features, and how to install it. However, enabling and installing WSL on the most recent versions of Windows (Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, or Windows 11) is now as easy as typing the following command in an administrator command prompt or Windows PowerShell window, which can be found be searching in the start menu for either and right clicking the icon to select Run as administrator. ``` wsl install ``` :::note By default, this command installs Ubuntu as the Linux distribution, which is popular among those new to Linux. If you are interested in other distributions, see the guide. ::: On older version of Windows 10, you can install WSL manually. Once WSL is installed, you can start it in a command prompt or PowerShell window by entering `wsl`.  Getting Started The first thing to do on a fresh install is to update any out of date software. A Package Manager makes this easy on Linux: it's like the app store on your phone, but for all of the software on your computer. On Ubuntu, the default package manager is apt. You can update everything at once using the following commands. ``` sudo aptget update && sudo aptget upgrade ```  Shell: Bash, Zsh, or many others  Description A shell is used to interact with your system and run programs using text commands. It is often favoured over or used alongside a graphical user interface (GUI) environment by programmers. Windows running WSL, Mac, and Linux each can use a different default shell, but all Unix shells will share the same basic commands.  Installing On Windows, see the WSL section. A shell will be installed with your distribution of Linux. On Mac, use the 'Terminal' app.  Getting Started Typically, a shell will display some information before your cursor, though the format can differ. In this example, everything up to and including the dollar sign is information provided to you by the shell about you and your system. ```sh username@computername foldername/or/path$ echo 'Chip says hello' ```\n\n    Answer the student's query: Can I use a windows computer for programming?\n"

Windows running WSL, Mac, and Linux each can use a different default shell, but all Unix shells will share the same basic commands.  Installing On Windows, see the WSL section. A shell will be installed with your distribution of Linux. On Mac, use the 'Terminal' app.  Getting Started Typically, a shell will display some information before your cursor, though the format can differ. In this example, everything up to and including the dollar sign is information provided to you by the shell about you and your system. ```sh username@computername foldername/or/path$ echo 'Chip says hello' ```\n\nAlthough Linux OS may be confusing for new users, becoming comfortable with a UNIX/Linux environment is very beneficial for you. The University generally expects you to produce code/projects that will work on its Linux server. As well, Linux forces you to interact with the command line more, which is great if you want to learn more about how your computer works underneath. Almost all Linux distros are free, especially the popular ones. In general, Linux distros require less disk space and perform better on lowend devices, compared to Windows. Thus, the right Linux distro will significantly optimize your laptop, especially if you are on a budget. However, Linux is also generally worse for battery life compared to other OS.  MacOS Since the MacOS is a UNIX operating system, it is usually easier to set up local programming environment than Windows. As well, it is also among the most supported OS in terms of IT support and app availability. However, MacOS is generally not compatible with nonApple products. This means that you would need to purchase a MacBook to use MacOS, which may be expensive/less costeffective depending on your budget and what specifications you're looking for. Much like Linux OS, it can be difficult to game on. Depending on how important gaming is to you, you may need to use Wine, set up a virtual machine, or dualboot with Windows.  ChromeOS (Chromebook) The ChromeOS is a Linuxbased operating system derived from the Chromium OS. However, ChromeOS is generally not compatible with nonChromebook products. Although Chromebooks are typically lightweight, portable and have good battery life, you usually cannot install much on them since they generally have low specifications. Although you can set up programming environments on them using a Linux container, having a low hardware specifications may decrease the performance. As such, Chromebooks (or other laptops like Surface Pro) are best used for doing quick works on the campus while having a more powerful desktop/laptop at home.  Battery Life and Portability Battery life and portability are probably the most important factors that you should think about when purchasing a laptop. You should purchase a laptop that has decent battery life and is reasonably light. Alternatively, you can look for ergonomicallyengineered laptop bags that can store your chargers so that you won't get hurt as you exercise around the campus. Some factors, like a laptop's hardware, may affect its weight and battery life. Powerful CPUs, for example, often drains battery quicker. Extremely small and lightweight laptops often have smaller fans and vents and thus heat up easily, which can also reduce battery life. It is therefore important to research about your laptop choices and test them in person before making a purchase.  Screen Size Common screen size range from 13' to 17', but it is recommended to keep your selection between 13'' to 15'' for portability. If you are looking for a more portable laptop, then 13'' will be a better choice. However, this also means that you will see less content on the screen at a time, especially when you make the fonts bigger for ergonomic purposes. On the other hand, a 15'' laptop can display more content but are also heavier and thus less portable.  Other Features Although features like 2in1 and touchscreen are very useful for purposes like digital art, they may not be very useful on the campus other than taking digital notes. If you are purchasing a laptop that is going to mostly be used on campus, then you can subsitute with a drawing tablet to save money.\n\n    Answer the student's query: What if I use Linux on my computer for class\n"

            "content": "Using Linux on your computer for class can be quite beneficial, especially for programming and development tasks. Here are some important points to consider:\n\n1. **Environment Setup**: Linux/UNIX makes it easy to set up the necessary programming environment, which is crucial for many Computer Science classes. The University of Windsor\u2019s servers run on Debian, so using a similar Linux distribution can help ensure compatibility when you access those resources.\n\n2. **Programming**: If you choose Linux as your primary OS, you'll find that many programming tasks may be easier to manage compared to Windows. Most languages and tools can be conveniently installed and run in the Linux environment.\n\n3. **Software Compatibility**: While most of the University's software (like Office 365 and OneDrive) is available on the Microsoft platform, you might encounter some compatibility issues. However, these can often be managed with the right tools or through alternative software options available on Linux.\n\n4. **Game Development**: If gaming is important to you, remember that Linux can be more challenging for gaming. You may need to use Wine, set up a virtual machine, or dual-boot with Windows if you want a good gaming experience.\n\n5. **Community Support**: If you are new to Linux, distributions like Ubuntu and Debian have large user communities, which can be very helpful for troubleshooting and finding solutions to issues you might encounter.\n\nIn summary, using Linux can enhance your learning experience in the Computer Science program due to its strong support for programming, but you should be prepared to deal with potential compatibility issues and the learning curve associated with a new operating system."

See this map if you would like to see the different UWindsor buildings beforehand.  Official UWindsor Parking Spaces There are 17 official parking lots within the UWindsor campus. This includes visitor parking, staff parking, and student parking. You can locate these parking lots in this campus map. a map outlining official uwindsor parking spaces for students, staff, and visitors  Student Designated Parking Student parkings in UWindsor are either payanddisplay, permitonly, or both. Most student parkings are located around Alumni Hall, with a few more parking locations in Leddy, Cartier Hall, Assumption Hall, and the downtown campus. To obtain a student permit, visit the UWindsor Parking Online Services. Permits are either 8 months or 12 months (for Fall & Winter), or 2 months or 4 months (for Intersession & Summer). :::note While some of these locations (such as the Parking Garage) do not accept cash, some other parking locations (like Leddy special night parking) are coin entry only. For places where student permits and payanddisplay options are both allowed, you do not need to pay if you already have a student permit, but you must display your permit on your vehicle when parking. The hourly rate for parking is $2.00/hr, up to $10.00 maximum per day. As well, even if you have a student permit (or parking pay stub), you must follow the University's parking regulations. The University will fine or, whenever necessary, tow your vehicle if they discover that you have violated the regulations. :::  Visitor Parking Space Visitors are able to use the Parking Garage and the designated visitor parkings around the area. Unlike students and staff, visitors cannot buy semester/year parking passes. Instead, visitors must pay a parking rate by the hour, by the day, by the week, or by the month. However, the University also provides vendor permits in the student parking lots.  Accessible Parking The University of Windsor will provide accessible parking to people who requests parking spaces. If you require accessible parking or any other accommodations, make sure to contact the Campus Parking Services and the Office of Human Rights, Equity and Accessibility. They will work with you to make sure that your requests will be fulfilled to the best of their abilities.

The hourly rate for parking is $2.00/hr, and there is no parking fees when you park during the afterhours (after 6:00 p.m. on MonSat, or during Sundays and holidays). a map showing the City of Windsor street parkings around the University of Windsor campus The detailed version of the street parking map can be accessed here. :::note While many of these parking spaces are accessible to students, it must be noted that some of these parking spaces are available only to the residents nearby; any vehicles parked there must present a residential parking permit to not be fined or towed. :::  Accessible Parking\n\nid: wifiguide title: WiFi Guide sidebarlabel: WiFi Guide slug: /guides/wifi  This is a guide to connecting to WiFi on campus.  WiFi Networks available When you connect your wireless WiFi device (phone/PC/Mac) to the network, you will see the available wireless networks listed which you can try to connect to.  eduroam  uwinsecure  uwindsor Which should you use? The short answer is \u201cConnect to eduroam\u201d. The eduroam wireless network is available to all wireless users (Students/Faculty/Staff/guests). Plus it has the additional benefit that users from other eduroam institutions (many universities, for example) can also connect to the University of Windsor\u2019s wireless network using their home institution\u2019s crededentials.  Eduroam  The Preferred Wireless Network alt text Eduroam is a network used by many universities, and your UWindsor sign in will work at any campus that uses eduroam. 1. Open WiFi settings on your device and select the \u201ceduroam\u201d network 2. Depending on your device you will be prompted for different settings. Here is the list of all possibilities. Fill in any you see. (Most computers will only ask for Username and Password)  For Windows and iPhone <  EAP method: PEAP  Phase 2 authentication: MSCHAPV2  CA certificate: Use System Certificates (or leave blank if this is not an option) >  Identity (username): Your full UWindsor email (example@uwindsor.ca) <  Anonymous identity: Your full UWindsor email (example@uwindsor.ca) >  Password: Your UWinID password If prompted to trust a certificate after signing in (mainly iPhone) click trust.

Unlike eduroam and uwinsecure, the uwindsor network does not encrypt the network traffic. So, for example, if you are accessing network applications using a protocol which is insecure, (eg. http instead of https), then everyone else using the uwindsor network in the vicinity could view your network activity. The wireless network called uwindsor is not secure.  For Residence Students While Eduroam is the primary campuswide WiFi network, you may want to use UWinResLife in your hall for heavier use (i.e. streaming or downloading). Sign in using your UWindsor ID (just the first part  not @uwindsor.ca), and your UWinID password.  Activating Your UWindsor Account You use your UWindsor ID to sign into your UWinsite Student, Brightspace, MySuccess, etc. Your UWindsor email address is your ID @uwindsor.ca and signin is via Gmail. To activate your ID, you will require your 9digit Student Number and 4digit Personal Access Code (PAC). Find these by searching your inbox, or on your acceptance letter. Visit the Leddy Library or the Computer Centre to use an internetenabled computer and activate your account.\n\n1. On the Student Homepage, click the Manage Classes tile. 2.

It addresses some general information about being a student at the University of Windsor and provides resources specifically to help students succeed in computer science courses.  Getting Started at the University of Windsor  UWin Accounts Every student must have a UWin Account in order to access the university's online services. Instructions to set up your UWin account will be sent to your personal email after you've been accepted into a program at the university. You will be assigned a UWin ID and will create a password during this process; these will be used as your login information. Your UWindsor email will be yourUWinI@uwindsor.ca.  Online Services Some of the online services you can access using your UWin Account include:  UWinsite Student For browsing and enrolling in classes, viewing tuition and fees, accessing acedamic information, applying for scholarships, and more. See the UWinsite Guide for more details and help.  Brightspace The university's Learning Management System (LMS). It is used to view course material, submit coursework, review grades, and more.  Microsoft Office 365 All University of Windsor students have access to a full suite of Microsoft Office 365 tools and software, including Outlook for email services and OneDrive for 1 TB of free cloud storage. A Microsoft Account is automatically created using your UWindsor Email and UWin Account Password. See this FAQ for more details.  Enrolling in Courses  Which Courses to Take :::important These wiki resources are maintained by student contributors. Always verify important academic information with a primary university resource or an academic advisor. ::: There are several computer science programs offered by the University of Windsor, each with their own course requirements which can be found in the undergraduate calendar. If you follow the recommended course sequence, many programs will share the same courses for the first term. They are COMP1000, COMP1400, MATH1250 (or MATH1260), MATH1720 (or MATH1760), and an elective. See the Courses section for a userfriendly table of course requirements by program.  How to Enroll Incoming first year students typically have the earliest appointment time and may enroll in courses before all other students. Your appointment time can be found on UWinsite under My Academics > Enrollment Deadlines. It is recommended to enroll as early as possible, as courses have a limited capacity and desireable timeslots fill up quickly. See the UWinsite Guide for more details on how to enroll in classes.  Recommended Software for Computer Science As a computer science student, you will learn to program in a variety of programming languages, starting with the C Programming Language in COMP1400. Installing and familiarizing yourself with the necessary software on your personal computer before the first day of classes will save you time and stress, especially if you are new to programming. All of the following software can be downloaded for free.  Code Editor: Visual Studio Code  Description A code editor helps a programmer write code (like Microsoft Word but for programming). Code can be written in any text editor, but a good code editor will provide features like syntax highlighting, basic error checking, and autocompletion for several programming languages. Note that a code editor is not an IDE (integrated development environment). For example, Visual Studio is an IDE while Visual Studio Code is a code editor and a seperate piece of software. An IDE will typically provide builtin tools to run, debug, and examine your code for a specific language, while a code editor will not (or will require you to install additional tools to do so).\n\nSection 1 - Name The name of this organization shall be the Computer Science Society. Section 2 - Purpose The objective of the society shall be to promote an interest in Computer Science and to enhance the lives of computer science students on campus. Section 3 - Membership Society Membership shall consist of: All students who are currently enrolled on a full-time basis at the University of Windsor majoring in a program offered by the department of Computer Science. Any student at the University of Windsor, who is not otherwise covered by part a, may purchase a membership for $20 per semester. Section 4 - Independence The Computer Science Society is and will remain a separate, independent group. To protect the interest of society members, the society shall never amalgamate or be absorbed by any other student group or society (other than the University of Windsor Students' Alliance).\n\n    Answer the student's query: Is parking free in University of Windsor?\n"

The Exchange Coordinator, Michelle, is a fantastic and knowledgable person and can help you with any concerns/questions. You can hear about Jose's experience here:  Jose's University of Essex Experience In addition, you can also watch this series of UWindsor video clarifying some information about Student Exchange, or you can contact Michelle Bondy.  Open Office Hours with Michelle  Eligibility Requirement When you apply to go on a student exchange, the following requirements are considered. These requirements aren't set in stone, however, and you may still be considered during special circumstances or if you can satisfy the requirements in some other way.  Be enrolled in a UWindsor degree program during the exchange.  Have a cumulative average of 72%+ at the time of application.  Be in good academic standing.  Have completed two years (~20 courses) worth of Universitylevel education before exchange.  Proficiency in second language (when the host institution does not teach in English). In addition, you must follow these exchange policies as CS students:  You can only exchange for up to one academic year per degree program.  You must have a full course load (as defined by the host institution) during the exchange.  You will not normally be eligible for refund of tuition if you withdraw from exchange before completing the current semester.  If you took classes recognized for credit by the host institution for their students, then these classes will be recognized for credit by UWindsor. The opposite also applies.  Your grades in these courses will be transformed into UWindsor grades.  Exchange Destinations Students in Computer Science programs can go to different destinations of exchange depending on the program/host institution applied for. Usually, each program/host institution has only 14 spots for exchange. This number of spaces, however, can change depending on the agreements made between the University of Windsor and the host institution. Since not all spaces are available every year or every semester, it is strongly recommended that you check the Destination by Major and Current Available Destinations before you apply for your destination of choice. Depending on the host institution, you may be required to prove proficiency in the language that the institution teaches in. As for now, the following destinations available to CS students teach in a language other than English:  France  Germany  Italy  Mexico In such scenario, you may need to take a language assessment with the Languages department as arranged by the Exchange Office.  Exchange Expenses Here are some expenses that you should consider before going on an exchange:  Tuition and ancillary fees   UWindsor students will continue to pay their normal UWindsor tuition and ancillary fees, and no tuition/application fees are charged by the host institution.   Student association fees, however, are waived.   UWSA supplementary health insurance are charged, but students can still optout.  Travel and accommodation/living costs   These costs will also include costs for visa, passport and other travel documents.   The host institution can help students find accommodations, generally in the forms of student residence and meal plans.  Insurance   Students must purchase health insurance, in addition to OHIP, appropriate for the country of destination.   The host institution may provide this insurance for students to purchase. The University of Windsor has a page detailing some of the financial assistance you can receive for exchange. Students can also apply to the University of Windsor International Mobility Award. In addition, the Government of Canada and Ontario has programs to provide financial aid for students studying abroad.\n\nSometimes, your country of destination may also provide financial aid programs for students studying in their country. If your country of destination allows international students to do parttime work, you may also work during exchange to cover a part of your expenses.  Application Process Students interested in applying must have these components in their application:  Exchange Online Application  Three Reference Letters/Forms   The form must be completed and returned by the references, not the student.   One of the three references must be a UWindsor faculty member who has taught the student in a class.  Language Assessment (if applicable) After applying, you may be interviewed by the Exchange Office to determine your interest in the exchange program. The Exchange Office has a selection committee who will review the applications, interview the applicants, and rank candidates based on the following criteria:  Seriousness of interest   This can be demonstrated in the depth of research you showcase about the school(s) you applied for.  Suitability of the host institution\u2019s program for degree requirements  Ability to be a good ambassador and representative of the University and the city while away  Interesting classes you noted when making your application for exchange   You are not expected to make a class schedule when applying for exchange, but this is a nice bonus point.  Personal adaptability  Participation in university and community life  Academic ability The interview may be conducted in a second language if the school(s) you applied for does not teach in English. In addition, the interview is a great opportunity for you to ask some questions you have about the exchange.  Important Deadline :::important You should send in your complete application (including the language assessment and reference forms to be sent by the references) before the specified deadline to get priority when considered for exchange placements. Although late applications are still accepted, late applicants are only considered when there is remaining space and time. :::  January 15th (before 3 pm)  application deadline for students beginning exchange in September (1 or 2 semesters)   Applications are usually available around midOctober.  September 15th (before 3 pm)  application deadline for students beginning exchange in January (1 semester)   Applications are usually available around late June. Generally, students are recommended to apply during their second year and begin exchange during their third year to allow for flexibility in course selection when studying abroad. To ensure that your graduation is not delayed, you should consult with your academic department/advisor about the interest you have for the exchange program. :::note Students going on exchange in their final semester may have their convocation delayed due to the time needed to process transfer credits.\n\nCO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION The Co-operative Education Program is available for the following degrees: Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours Applied Computing) Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Information Systems) Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Science with Software Engineering Specialization) Introduction The Co-operative Education Program offers students the opportunity to combine their classroom experiences with related work experiences. Students who apply and are accepted into the Co-operative Education Program must successfully complete at least three paid work experiences interspersed throughout the four-year Honours program. The experience gained while participating in these structured and supervised work placements is viewed as an integral component of the student's educational program.\n\n    Answer the student's query: How can I become an exchange student?\n"

Head over to the instructions section.  Why You Should Become a UWSA Ratified Club There are many reasons why you should consider becoming a UWSA ratified club. Whether you're starting a new club or thinking of taking your existing club to the next level, becoming UWSA ratified may be incredibly useful  Legitimacy Being a UWSA club means your group is officially recognized, and as such, your club gains legitimacy. Knowing that your club has as organization behind it helps move things forward with administration and helps to show your members that your club is 'real'.  Support Managing a club is hard, but managing a club without someone to go to is even harder. One of the great things about being a part of UWSA is the advice and support they can provide. Whenever you aren't sure about something or need administrative advice on how to run your club, UWSA is able to provide support.  Financials A common problem with clubs is finding a safe and reliable place to store club funds. UWSA allows all student groups to store their funds in the UWSA account, which eliminates this problem. You can deposit cash and cheques with UWSA to store the funds safely, and ensure they carry over year after year. There are two main ways to use the funds in your UWSA account: reimbursement and purchase orders.  Reimbursement The main way you'll be able to make use of your club funds is via reimbursement. This means you pay for something out of your own money, send a cheque request, and UWSA will send you the money. Cheque requests need to be approved by at least two of the three executives (President, Vice President, Treasurer).  Purchase Orders Sometimes, UWSA can make purchases on your behalf to avoid club members needing to pay out of pocket. This typically only happens for larger purchases. For example, if your group wants to spend $500 to get tshirts for group members, UWSA can purchase the shirts on your group's behalf (so long as your group has sufficient funds).  If you ever have any questions about UWSA group financials, send an email to vpfuwsa@uwindsor.ca  Ratification Instructions 1. Have three people to serve as the President, Vice President, and Treasurer of the group. 2. Have these three executives sign the UWSA signature form. 3. Collect the contact information of at least 10 additional members to be part of the club. This means at least 13 members total, 3 executives and 10 general members.   You may want to use something like Microsoft Forms or Google Forms to collect this info.   You should collect their name and UWindsor email. 4. Send an email to studentgroups@uwindsor.ca and uwsa@uwindsor.ca with the member contact information list, the signature form, and a short description of your club. 5. Allow up to a week to hear a response, if you don't hear anything then send a follow up email.  Resources  UWSA Signature Form  Student Groups Resources Page  Student Groups Policy and Handbook  Cheque Requesition Form  Tips to Make Your Club Successful\n\nSection 1 - Election of Officers Elections are to be held annually under the auspices of the University of Windsor Students' Alliance (UWSA) where they are capable of carrying out said elections. An annual election shall take place in March, with offices filled in May. Any positions not filled in the annual election may be appointed on a temporary basis by a simple majority of the Executive at an executive meeting. The First-Year Representative, and any positions not elected in the annual election (including positions temporarily held), shall be elected during the first month of the fall semester. The elected positions shall be all positions except Head of Technology, Secretary, and all affiliate positions. The President, Vice President, and Treasurer positions are restricted to individuals who have held a previous position in the Computer Science Society. If no member who has previously held a position in the Computer Science Society is nominated for either of these positions, then any Computer Science student may be considered for nomination. In the event of no new executive being elected, a group of Computer Science students may petition the UWSA VP Administration to represent the Computer Science Society on a temporary basis subject to election in the first month of the fall semester. Section 2 - Removal of Executive or Council Member In the event that a member is not fulfilling their responsibilities, the following procedure shall take place: The President will meet with the member to discuss concerns raised by the membership. If, after one week, the member is still not found to be fulfilling their responsibilities, the President shall issue a written warning. After an additional week, if the member is still not found to be fulfilling their responsibilities, a meeting will be called to determine whether the individual will retain their position. Note: In the event the member in question is the President, the Vice President will conduct the above procedure. Section 3 - Meeting to Remove an Executive or Council Member An Executive meeting shall be called to determine whether a member shall continue to retain their position. At least one-week notice shall be given before the meeting. The member in question will be given an opportunity to address any issues and concerns raised, answer any questions as well as provide reasons why they should continue to hold their position. Voting shall take place by secret ballot. Quorum for the meeting shall be all of the executives, not including the accused. If quorum is not met, or in the event that a two-thirds vote is not obtained, the individual shall retain their position. No minutes shall be published for this meeting, beyond the immediate result. Section 4 - Constitutional Amendments The constitution can be amended at a regular meeting, or a general meeting, with a three-fourths majority vote. Any amendments must be announced one week prior to either meeting. Amendments that only include stylistic, grammatical, typographical, graphical, or formatting changes can be made to the constitution outside of a meeting, without the need for an announcement one week prior, with a three-fourths majority vote. This vote may be electronic or in-person, as decided by the President. Section 5 - Interpretation of Bylaws These bylaws are to be interpreted by the Executive. Section 6 - Conflicts with UWSA Policy Nothing in this instrument shall be read to contradict UWSA rules regarding clubs or societies. In the event where a contradiction shall occur, the rules of the UWSA shall have precedent. Section 7 - Parliamentary Authority The rules contained in the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised shall govern CSS in all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with these bylaws and any special rules of order CSS may adopt. Section 8 - Resignations An executive member may resign from their position by submitting a written notice to the Executive at least two weeks in advance. The President shall be responsible for filling the vacant position, by appointment or election, as the President deems necessary. In the case of the resignation of the President, the position shall be filled by the Vice President until the next election.\n\nSection 1 - Name The name of this organization shall be the Computer Science Society. Section 2 - Purpose The objective of the society shall be to promote an interest in Computer Science and to enhance the lives of computer science students on campus. Section 3 - Membership Society Membership shall consist of: All students who are currently enrolled on a full-time basis at the University of Windsor majoring in a program offered by the department of Computer Science. Any student at the University of Windsor, who is not otherwise covered by part a, may purchase a membership for $20 per semester. Section 4 - Independence The Computer Science Society is and will remain a separate, independent group. To protect the interest of society members, the society shall never amalgamate or be absorbed by any other student group or society (other than the University of Windsor Students' Alliance).\n\n    Answer the student's query: What is the UWSA club?\n"

This is why you may not be able to connect with NoMachine or SSH. If you\u2019re connecting from home and anywhere outside or inside the campus, you have to connect via a VPN server to access resources and data on the campus private network. This is a guide on how to setup the VPN.  Download First download the VPN client for your respective machine.  Download for Windows and macOS  Authenticate with your UWinID and password on the university's GlobalProtect Portal to get to the GlobalProtect Client download links. After that, click the link that matches your operating system.  Download for Android and Chrome OS  Follow the steps in the app when prompted. Also check which Chrome OS Systems support Android Apps if needed.  Download for iOS devices  Follow the steps in the app when prompted.  Download for Linux  Install openconnect using the package manager for your Linux distribution.

Some tips:  You can scroll through your command history using the up and down arrows.  ctrl+c can be used to kill a process that is running in your shell.  C Compiler: GCC  Description When you write C code, you need a way to make it executable on your system. This is where a compiler comes in: it reads in the more humanfriendly C code and outputs a program that your computer can read and run. GCC is the compiler you should use when developing C code for your classes, unless your professor specifies otherwise. When you compile code using a different compiler, or on a different system, your program may behave differently than it will on the school's system using GCC. For this reason, it is also sometimes recommended that you double check your programs on the School of Computer Science's systems before submitting more complicated assignments.  Installing On Windows running WSL with Ubuntu , enter the following into your shell: ``` sudo aptget install gcc ``` On Mac, this video provides one way of installing GCC, as well as the Homebrew package manager.  Getting Started This section will help you create a sample C program, compile it, and run it. Copy and paste the following code into a new file on your system. Call it 'hello.c' and remember where you save it. ```c include <stdio.h> int main(void) {  printf('Chip says hello'); } ``` Find the file in your shell. For example, if you put the file on your Desktop, use the following command to go to there. ```sh cd ~/Desktop ``` Compile the program into a binary (runnable file, executable, etc.).  `Wall` tells the compiler to output all warnings.  `o hello.out` tells the compiler to save the created binary with the name 'hello.out'. ```sh gcc Wall hello.c o hello.out ``` Run the binary you just created. ```sh ./hello.out ``` The output should be ``` Chip says hello ```  Remote Connection: SSH and NoMachine  Description As a computer science student, you have access to the School of Computer Science's servers, which provide software in a Linux environment that you are free to use. On campus, they can be accessed using School of Computer Science computer labs. Remotely, they can be accessed in several ways.  SSH (recommended): Remotely use a shell on the server.  NoMachine: Remote desktop environment. :::important  You must authenticate your UWin account with the School of Computer Science before you can log in remotely.  To log in remotely from offcampus, you must be on the VPN first. Please refer to our guide on how to set up the VPN here. :::  SSH In a shell, use the following to connect to the school's servers. Replace 'UWinID' with your UWinID. ``` ssh UWinID@cs.uwindsor.ca ``` For example, if chipcoolcat@uwindsor.ca wanted to connect, they would use the following command. ``` ssh chipcoolcat@cs.uwindsor.ca ```\n\nid: wifiguide title: WiFi Guide sidebarlabel: WiFi Guide slug: /guides/wifi  This is a guide to connecting to WiFi on campus.
